i am a lost soul to you .
why ?
o 'brien !
no !

these gestures appear to be like the most powerful reflexes he can perform without knowing its symbolic meaning .
after that , every time , even when we were fighting , or i was mad at him because he 'd forgotten ... the trash can or ... and i took a quick look at the tattoo , i remembered that this guy loved me .
let go .
carol .
because i 'm damn good !
but it was you , dell .
