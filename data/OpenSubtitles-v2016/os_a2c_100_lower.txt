i understand your sense of duty , your loyalty to your captain , but there 's something stronger between us , a connection beyond that .
did you hear about warner brothers ?
what did you say ?
so it 's mom 's fault you couldn 't get there ?
where is he ?

buddies and my buddies , i 'm glad you made it .
what 's wrong , abs ?
they took an ad .
lisa , bailey , wayne ...
the car 's at the bottom of the compound .
she couldn 't have been thrown against the rock .
you mean the rooster ?
you want flowers ?
we 'll let the parents come .
what ?
a shower always works wonders .
the room is upstairs .
- hey .
i expected that .
look , my new dog .
he 's in pain .
you tried to fuck me to get back to vic ?
- promise me
is that one of us ?
i have to go ...
i got $ 1,000 .
yes .
- that 's wing ...
- he didn 't ask for permission .
take him away .
- great idea .
and as you wish , the theater will pick you up .
i 'm terribly sorry .

- how are you ?
he didn 't save me .
a bottle of vodka , please .
we 're going to fresno as a team leader only from laughlin .

let 's go to mommy .
clean up the mess .
i 'm coming !
you must realize that .

probably not in heaven .
i want to go home , please .
- so you want to bribe me ?
i think i was .
if you think i 'm your lover , you 're wrong .
- whatever .
but every time the phone rings , he jumps like crazy through the house .
i know you live there , but i still have a funny feeling you 're following me , matteo .
honey ?
we lost everything !
- get to the side of the road .
- by burning the journals .
- peter .
it 's kind of an obsession .
miss elizabeth 's patience is exhausted .
i 've been thinking .
you down there , this is the police !
frankly , without wanting to offend anyone ... it 's not wise for miss .
- you 're such a good daughter .
you should leave my house right now .
you 'll pay for this !
this is the mother who made a lot of mistakes .
even the band had to believe that even though he never did anything bad about her .
- whatever .
i advise you to be pragmatic
- holy shit !
it 's true , your honor , i 've been to the bottom of an invitation to see what kind of deal we could make .

cowboy , listen .
i 'll relay your message as soon as i get back .

i heard this class was a piece of cake ?
he certainly would have the answer right away , wouldn 't he ?
yeah , until you have your own .
i 'll leave you to my colleague .
cooking .
- unfair ?
very sad .
and now you have to pay .
right over there .
you spend a lot more than me .
you 're all joking

- what 's that ?
i waited every wednesday for him to bring us the bread to see him .
i can now determine if she 's related to another life-form .
- isn 't there something that ...

but if i hadn 't come here , we would never have seen each other again .
- sure .
this is so stupid , so childish .
the war is finally approaching the end .
on the double .
i don 't understand , you did what ?

her mother was a teacher .
- can 't you go back to your old job ?
it 's so good to see you .
did i ever ...
- shall i go ?
what did you just say ?
- are you out here often ?
earth to max .
looks like the perfect way to burchell 's and fog 's .
what ?
if the owner had robbed his own store , he would have done it without a dog .

you have a great time .
actually , i didn 't see any of it .
i knew i had to kill again and again .
come here .
i 'm a little tired .
the memory of killing you will have to do .
i think what she 's trying to say is , yeah , she 'd be happy if you were our roommate .
- not until you say your name .
and a man .
but i changed like you did .
i 've always seen only sisters .

- where ?
an old model .
very unfortunate , if you have accepted this award .

excuse me ?
but i wanted to tell you that your poetry in creative writing was really good .
i will celebrate with the other witches and spirits here .
these are my wife and sister .
someone has to get in there and hold his hand .
we 're as quiet as a shadow and we 're burning up a little fuel .
a boyfriend ?
that 's what the authorities assured me .

and what about your sister and wade ?
the city , the way things work .
he lives in alameda 1 7 1 2 .
i took this when i was 18 .

hilton takes precedence , so i need you both to stand by .
i 'm just curious .
her heart has broken .
if you 're reasonable , we 'll find a solution together .
where are you taking these bags ?
which turns out dutch gets more gigs .
a lot of people were jealous of me .

he put the suit in the trunk before my eyes .
there 's money these days .
who knows ?
besides , you have to do your normal job today .

i don 't want to see you or your wart .
all these people , just ...
you make your opponent believe he wins , and then you start your second attack .
- miss jones , my office .
the money was never found .
he 's waving at us .
tell him i landed well , that he doesn 't have to worry this time .
show me .
the crooks or me , bender ?

i see .
well , perfect maybe .
holy shit .

i never got over it .
he 's downstairs .
a day or a night without a maid .
let me guess , you just met your sister .
- he wants to apply here .
- don 't you know ?
you should visit me .
a little creepy .
i was out of line .
is that all ?
it 's not london , of course .
no .
only two possibilities are open .
after you .
leave me alone .
an important call .
it became an international thriller where the sympathy comes from , as often as the time comes .
yes , after his death , and the lungs , and the punctured lung match the secretly maneuver .
eleven , twelve , thirteen ... twenty .
we 're running for the bet .
it 's sydney .
sasha 's in there .

maybe she saw your potential elsewhere .
okay .
wonderful !
- sure .
i had a cup of coffee .
i tried for 20 years , but he 's coming at you .
- why is that ?
we 're not saying anything .
the network was made of 57 people .
how did you meet her ?
we have to make sure mommy doesn 't meet us .
- i 'm sorry , i 'm speechless .
you 're fucking her , aren 't you ?
but this is my home .
don 't worry about nicki .
no leary has an account with us .
copy that .
- where 's the trumpet player ?
i can hold it for hours .
shit , let 's look at him .
ironically , this is exactly the end of the hook , which resulted in a rainy night in room 13 of the most violent .
do either of you want a dance ?
you think just because you have powers , you stand above everything and you 're special .
i should have gone with him .
i 'm a man of action , not a man .
get out .
see ?
you have to go .
i didn 't take that for a moment .
i even despise it .
for the first time in my life , the road is clear .
nobody believed me .
- congratulations , you caught him .
" don 't look and pour it down ! "
i 've always had problems with a bunch of kids .
if you feel so bad , you can buy me a pizza .
it 's the way the creatures like to do it .
it took me two weeks to get used to the breakup of you .
then where is she ?
all who are for the answer is raise your hand .
- that 's right .
if you 're careful , you can do it .
we don 't change the stakes because of your assumptions .
didn 't i say " take it " ?
- you 're lying .
i didn 't think there was glass here .
drugs ?
no .

that dumont wants to relieve staff .
i believe in you .
then say it .
to maggie 's family and friends .
i could have killed the man without an arm and both legs .
we 'll probably stay here longer .
yeah , good thing i didn 't .
he didn 't jump or fall .
i 'll be landing in less than 15 minutes .

this office is like a big house .
you want me to get cristina ?
- shame on you !
asking about what garrett said ?
- i 'm not on any fucking side .

saunders obviously has a daughter .
i love it !
not even your relationship with aiden mathis ?
think !
all we need is a bigger one !
you can 't be a jew !
that 's it ?
i still have 18 , but i only have shower .
but he loved her more than anything .
to say , " i 'm marilyn , " you could totally interpret it as a test .
help us !
i 'll never take another step in this supermarket .
- you 're kidding , right ?
i 'm trying to get used to it .
- i 'm not giving up .
we lost the horn .
i swear to god , i will stab you .

the man could take the day to the night with a clear look .
the night 's watch !
i love you .
let him go !

i wouldn 't be so sure .
she likes me .
- first you say it !
it was a beautiful ...

yeah .
hey , a guy like ... you knew he was never gonna be in .
bye .
i can run more tests for example , see if i can do anything .
- the boy 's in a coma .
- what 's going on ?
- we all go together .
he 's probably just kidding .
he 's an undercover agent .
congratulations .
i don 't love you anymore !
okay .
it 's from another source .
did he want to kiss you ?
they like men better than women .
we will obey the rules and follow the class .
do you really think a guy like that would allow the most part of his club to be defeated by a drug dealer ?
i hope so !
- do you know where she is now ?
see , boy , she 's waiting for you .
i 'm sure clay 's mother said the same thing about him .
and they swing

the pirates could call any minute .
you say no to me , boy ?
they tried to kill me .
cool .
who 's the third ?
flip , baby ?
i wasn 't informed of this witness .
it 's tempting .
and by the window at the coffee shop , a tramp will find himself telling him how great he is .
at home , he had a big surprise , and he reached into his pocket and brought out a gold coin that wasn 't there before .
fly tomorrow .
once in my life , i want to be a normal person .

i 've been summoned by the 8th air force ... to the first wave of the 58 air force .
that 's the most beautiful thing i 've ever seen !

good rules , rules , instead of a reason - because an organ that god put in your body is not what they 're forced to do .
you didn 't say a word .
okay , here we go . what do we print next week ?
he 's played the role over the years and with great conviction .
no .
i 'll die first !
i work in that office over there .
can you turn it down ?
i 'm tired , damon .
i 'll find a way .
you think ?
the minute that body fell to ground , this became a completely different story .
how should i know ?
it 's still our friends .
they drink our blood , they can take our form , they run three times as fast as we do , and , oh , yeah , one more thing .
he 's on our ass !
oh , it was you ?
nothing happened in the bathroom .
i have proof .
hut !
aberdeen will take care of me .
- i 'm not hungry .
it took me so long to get to that point to ... it 's not working .
maybe some black pepper will help .
you want to stay , but i 'll take your boy with me .
for a man of your principles , the only honorable step is to resign .
when ?
there is no way to repeat the history of the war .
- indeed !
the whole thing has changed .
- no , you don 't .
that was you and your brother-in-law bernie , you made all your savings and opened a chemical dry cleaner with the capital .
he keeps customers happy at night , goes foreign or ...
you can 't be prosecuted for the same crime twice .
we 're looking for someone big .

a maniac with a crazy hair wanted to get into my car ! "
and you and mr. spock , captain .
it 's a family thing .
no one came to see if i was still breathing .
let 's say 40,000 for each .
the case is officially closed .
- boy , wait !
because if you were dead and on happy corpses , you would have protected me from him because we 're friends and all that shit .
when a man finds his destiny in life , his fear ends .
- a special friend of the king ?
maybe i could have done something .
i want to talk to heather hills .
they say ... go to the clinic ... for an appointment with a doctor .
she already does .
he 's a fortune teller .

he helped me with a few cases over the years .
later , two guys tried to kill us .
what did i say ?
" what 's the difference , he 'll cancel your face . "
you 're an expert ?
he 's manipulative .
the last time the comet appeared , you should be the victim .
second in vietnam .
which means we don 't have to use bullets either .
he said it was over .
you broke up with him ?
- i have a girl , she 's as big as you .
but i liked it better before .

two soups , two salads , two salads , two cokes .
you killed your wife !
and just as she should have said , " oh , stuart , " she said , your name .
can you think again ?
" sugar rush . "
i 've been thinking about your book .
of course .
how wonderful , ladies !
you wouldn 't say anything .
you sure ?
i made her talk .
- have you ever been to venice ?
what the hell are you getting at , abner ?
and besides , i don 't think you have any friends .
i would have noticed .
you 're coming .
yo , there 's no such thing as a bad pussy .
what does an assistant do on average these days ?
no !
he wrapped his arms around her .
good to know , otherwise i would have pulled my favorite .
sweet or sweet with mom !
i 'm just emptying the water supply .
see you in court , doctor .
he pointed the direction and ran away .
oh , my god , i 've been thinking ...
if he leaves , you can stay !
you 're right .
- what ?
we 're already over that part .
hi .
i thought , " okay ... "
the lights are landing in the march .
let me tell you something .
- no .
mayday .
can you excuse us for a second ?
it doesn 't make sense .
look how consciously this woman is clinging to her bed .
maybe i 'm scared .
- fellas .
that 's why your opinion is so important to him .
- just another one .
i love you , too .
i was on the ship .

they should have been notified .
unfortunately , we can 't allow items like that in the vault .
so i need ...
can i call the baby 's father , her parents ?
[ chuckles ]
don 't you want your husband and daughter ?
i ask you , whatever happens , pass them on to them .
does that apply to technical units ?
it 'll be fine .
but i see your face .
there you go .
next time .
why do you ask ?
then how do you know how 100 years ago life could have been on earth ? "
even months after the bloody war , they all fought hard .
well , sheldon , there 's something about that van you 're gonna find very interesting .

he was my husband .
i don 't know .
you don 't have to worry .
yeah .
good evening .

you like it ?
i beg your forgiveness ?
- are you okay ?
but pain makes people selfish , he makes us blind .
no , he was fine in albuquerque for six months , but that jerk had to go to see his dying mother .
where 's my phone ?
by me , in emergencies .
only to draw attention to israel without ever seeing the land .
we need to set up a shunt to get more blood to the lungs .

five .
- there never is .
- stay at 20 .
they won 't believe what we found in the trunk .
and a portrait ?
maybe you can find him .

maybe we should take some food .
i 'm almost grateful .
i have a friend , and those are his shoulders , not yours .
i choose my friend .
i wasn 't interested .
what are you doing here ?
go get the girl back .
and then it started .
john just wants to talk to you .
she 's been here since the beginning .
he said something very important .
i 'll just need a day or two .
who are we ?

he would have come anyway .
now we can talk .

and i 'm just a dancer .
the water was wonderful .
- i 'll take that , sir .
you 're mean yourself .
king heinrich sends his love to you .

i 'm getting out .
and i 've worked very hard and i 've done very well , and nothing has changed here .
don 't shake your head , victor .

- how is she ?
- yeah .
- we should handle this .
okay .

yeah , but i wasn 't over it .

you 're taking me for a really complicated part .
* as he spoke to you in galilee
how much of a little change of power can make ...
give it to me .
so am i going out ?
that 's when i thought i 'd be lying on the floor .
it 's okay .
he took it well .
what 's the plan for our dinner today ?
- oh !
when i woke up , some weirdo jerked off in the middle of my face and there 's crabs , man !
so shut up !
my pale complexion ?
being queen is not so bad .
go ahead .
he 's pulling us out of cover .
because of the heavy events and because he wanted me to do it .
here .
there , again !
if i don 't sell it , i 'm broke .
just one question .
i told you this was the decision to make ... did you seriously believe we didn 't know anyone on the committee ?
in my report , i try to forget your remarks .

hey , dude , that 's the first thing you notice .
could it be that you missed a tiny detail ?
you say if i 'm crazy , i wouldn 't believe dr. thredson , but if i 'm sane , then my crazy stories would be right ?
- well done .
blue means pregnant .
so ?
stop rubbing it under my nose .
and he says , " in the cemetery . "
- you okay , amos ?
see the lights ?
i have enough feelings for both of us .
yeah , i 'll do it in french .
come on , we 're gonna be late .
it was actually my first time .
- do i hear a bar , five strips ?
it was in his pocket when he fell , so it 's exactly the same as he is , but i removed the key card and i removed the phone records ...
you can 't ?
ems , ems , that 's awesome .

they 're here to kill us .

- not me .
joe , there 's something ...
to make you look like this .
you don 't seem like me .

people jump out the window .
i went to the mountains to collect wood .
i haven 't seen him since he left .
and i could see where you work , you know , get to know your people , this boss who works at the museum at 11 : 30 .
[ chuckles ]
yeah ?
but people like you turned this country upside down .
let me guess ...
how about a dinner party after dinner ?
i 'll cover you .

he 's got a short one or something .
you 're right .

he 's asking you to call him back .

did you get up with the wrong foot ?
she 's stupid .
- would you ?
when i was on my mission in the southeast , a lot of talk about it .
- all right , then .
50 cents .
it 's also a matter of an even more efficient family name .
my favorite !
because it 's not true .
since the moment you wrote the criticism of the master 's work .
[ shouts ]
look , i need your help .
hey !
like you did with your jaffa ?
i didn 't do anything .
that 's great .
- we need to talk .
you know what ?
that 's a funny gift .
where are we ?
look , mr. ness ...
i 'd rather be more comfortable with my father than 13 million richer with whoever you are .
that look .
i 'll just go out the front door .
we 're not set up for that many , so we have to improvise .
what are the terms of the " minos " ?
he turned off the controls !
- did he wake up ?
the visitors can 't stay here .
and take the key to where it belongs .
listen , jake , if you want to stall me again ...

from the lady down the bar .
give me a hand .
my whole life is just fed and wrapped .

when i say pull out an arm for me , i don 't mean literally .

casey .
the dress is so tight .
that 's the shortest link between two points on solid ground .
all right , boys .
you were right .
i have to go now .
there 's a lot to forget .
and as it turns out , i 'm pretty good at it .
how come you got the safe in here , but you can 't get it out ?
and to your car .
the kids , those boy scouts .
i 'm a friend of the groom .

- i 'm really sorry .
their powers are gone .

everything is about power .
none of us have seen such a meeting .
i 'll see you in the morning .
- i 'd take a beer .
you don 't even have the right form here .
hey , that 's enough .
i wouldn 't just leave my yacht in the canal .
especially one the other team is afraid to attack .
it felt like he was trying to hurt me .
- yeah .
it 's not about the number .
yeah .
it 's time .
damn .
i 'll tell you .
won 't you sit down ?
if everything is all right , we can proceed as discussed .
- to think about me .
- the future is in the past .
to former soviet union .
there was such an idiot who blinded me with his eye .
- yeah .

and you dropped the charges , but i have to stay clean , okay ?
just an old , little one to make us feel safe .
i 'm with an idiot .
you gotta get out of here , it 's way too dangerous .
do it .
when they were hunting , they followed the mountain lion in the black earth , and they called him " slippery trail . "

he had to hook his victim .
stop !
that was marlene .
its continuing mission , to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations , ... .. to boldly go where no one has gone before .

you don 't think me and mr ...
friend , i 'm doing this for your sake .
i had to sit down .
my men are in the mountains .
we patched it up .
we 're being rushed , and we 're going to kill them peacefully , just as well as you .
there you go , in lois lane 's own words .
- i guess so .
that 's a nice truck .
if you accept all sides , you sleep much better .
it 's out of control .
and here we are right now ?
two minutes might be a little too long .
- i 'm not .
- there 's an animal in the basement !
on the ground !
hey !
- she 's a student .
hello .
- you hit my car !
and this time , you don 't have to change your mind .
- the eggs are on fire .
good boy !
i 'm not wearing a bathing suit .
but this will take longer time .
i 've got it much easier than erich , because i 'm not allowed outside .
i sent the flowers before the actual date , so i don 't have to break any of the rules .
i don 't suppose there was a rosie on the list ?
please , take whatever you want .

well , except this one .
oh , my god !
well , what things are has nothing to do with it , legal or not legal .
you know what ?
old bag .
can i ask what changed your mind ?
it contains some of the most powerful energy i 've ever seen .
it was my will .
i 'm tired .
i didn 't do a single medical thing today .
wait !
and millions in europe will die if we don 't stop them now .
no , never .

that son of a bitch .
thank you .
false alarm .
the baby 's listening .
- i 'll take it from there .
- war !
write your name on this sheet .
i hope i give gold for a little protection .
one thing 's for sure .
i 'd think they 'd like it if he didn 't get any confidential information .
what i can say is that ...
but not in thomas ' case .
and i 'm worried that the baby ...
he always said ...
do you belong to a strange , even more pathetic kind of idiot ?
he 's at night .
- four !
you saw the wrong picture as real !
someone might get the wrong guy , and ... that 's it .
we like it .
come on .
you don 't like finn .
20 minutes , 200 degrees and that 's it .
i didn 't get your name .
all you have to do is survive .
good evening .
that 's a good secret .
why ?
- yeah !
i 'm sorry , hurley , but we 're gonna have to lie .
- there she is .

master , help me .
- can we ?
- what exactly did he say ?
i 'm a lost soul to you .
why ?
o 'brien !
no !
- eventually .
excuse me .
these gestures seem like the reflexes he does without knowing its symbolic meaning .
after that , every time , even when we were fighting , or i was mad at him because he 'd forgotten ... the trash can or ... and i took a quick look at the tattoo , i remembered that guy loved me .
let go .
carol .
because i 'm damn good !
but it was you , dell .
bianca , the tribe has spoken .
this isn 't a game anymore .
we 've been sitting here for three hours .
i 'm sorry .

we 'd fry you for need .
carlos is dead and the dogs are gone .

unless you give me what i need to stop it .
well , it 's just here and in the mill .

my mother must think i 'm hungry and cooked for me .
there used to be no forest here .
what 's the occasion ?
i would have tried to warn someone there was something wrong on the station .
meg wouldn 't do that .
you 're just making a quick move .
i treat you badly ?
- i 'm done .

somewhere around here .
