knowing jim , he 'll find something .
let 's try this .
not yet .
and i can barely get it over my lips .
we 're expecting a new shipment next week .
nope , nothing yet .
i understand your sense of duty , your loyalty to your captain , but there is something stronger between us , a connection beyond that .
did you hear about warner brothers ?
what did you say ?
so it 's mom 's fault you couldn 't get there ?
where is he ?
- grab him .
that 's still my baby .
when we get back , i 'll give everyone a free pass .
give me marko .
- there 's a lot of them .
the florentines speak very highly of you .
- a frog .
that 's our welcome .
buddies and my college buddies , great that you made it .
what do you got , abbs ?
they filed an ad .
lisa , bailey , wayne ...
car 's at the north end of the compound .
she couldn 't have been thrown against the rock .
you don 't mean the rooster , do you ?
you want flowers ?
we 'll let the parents come .
what ?
a shower always works wonders .
the room 's upstairs .
- hey .
i expected that .
look , my new dog .
he 's in pain .
you tried to fuck me to get back to vic ?
- promise .
is that one of us ?
i have to go ...
i have $ 1,000 .
yes .

i 'm coming !
you must realize that .
you 're not strong enough .

you like me in green and yellow .
indians can survive in nature and feed themselves and clothe themselves with nothing but their hands .

i don 't know for sure until we remove the molten plastic , but hopefully , inside enough of the circuitry is intact .
probably not in heaven .
i want to go home , please .
- so you 're trying to bribe me ?
i think i was .
if you think i 'm your lover , you 're wrong .
- whatever you say .
but every time the phone rings , he jumps around the house like crazy .
i know you live there , but i still have a funny feeling you 're following me , matteo .
honey ?
we lost everything !
- pull over to the side of the road .
by burning the diaries .
- peter .
it 's kind of an obsession .
miss volkoff 's patience is exhausted .
i 've been thinking .
you down there , this is the police !
frankly , without wanting to offend anyone , it 's not wise for miss .
- you 're such a good daughter .
you should leave my house right now .
you 'll pay for this !
this is the wronged mother who 's made a lot of mistakes .
even your tape player had to believe it , even though he never did anything bad about you .
- whatever .
i advise you to be pragmatic .
- holy shit !
it 's true , your honor , i went to jnl to see what kind of deal we could make .

they 're having a great time .
actually , i didn 't see any of that .
i knew i had to kill again and again .
come here .
i 'm a little tired .
the memory of killing you will have to do .
cool .
- not until you tell me your name .
and a man .
but i changed , just like you did .
i 've only ever seen sisters .

- i 've been wearing boxer shorts for years .
more helpful than taking pictures of butters .
that 's why lex could be behind the kidnapping .
i knew it was a bad idea to go out with you .
what 's gotten into you ?
i think if teachers had looked like this when i was a kid , i might have stayed at school and made something of myself .
i 'll take your gun , but you 're not staying here .
hey , looking for someone ?
it burns , it burns .
- i 'll try .
he killed our son .
lucy , my dear , she didn 't deal with that in the novel , did she ?
- i don 't know .

nonsense .
i 'll give you another kiss .
they sent gunmen after us .
they 're putting weapons systems directly into the gps .

strange .
the leprechaun has his cock up the monkey 's ass , and morgan walks in and says ,
slumber parties were what made you cry .
- we 'll protect you .
why would he do that after she tried to kill him ?
ah , good !
- who are you ?
come here , man .
what 's your excuse ?
shit !
it must mean , " this is not a life . "
well , it 's just ...
where 's dubaku ?
oh , and how 's that ?
no .
come on .
i have no idea .
thank you .
- amen .
you 're lucky in life , huh ?
come on , settle down .
sophie !
finch .
all right , brother .
but there 's a guide here .
instead of having another thanksgiving with our screwed up families , we all come here and have a quiet and peaceful thanksgiving .
draw your apartment , julia .
are you kidding ?
i mean , i lied , i stole , and i blinded myself with the thought that i was still a good guy .
will you wake up ?
crazy .
- check the book .
hey , tara , i 'll see you ...
the guys at the table next to me specifically said what they liked about you .
do you know who that was ?
time 's running , dr. wade .

you okay ?
all right , so ...
you catch them , you catch them .
hello .
if i were your dead mother , i would now hand you this shield .
it 's time for me to leave you .
i don 't know what that means , but i think i 'm the nicest thing you 've ever said to me .
you know , as a prize winner , you gotta have a lot of money .
does that mean you knew mr. foley ?
he 's at st. benjamin 's hospital .
i can 't stop imagining the people sitting on it .
- but , but ...
- there are plenty of bodies .
the fire almost burned down the entire house , my mom died in the flames .
you just lost faith in yourself .
throw it back .
what do you think , henry ?
now that you know , you will return to the command staff .
it was stupid to bring her here .
- which is ?
sober .
how pathetic .
at least you can watch them kill me .
i killed him .
when we lie , those rhythmic nuances get more pronounced .
- no , you 're gonna die !
- don 't worry about me .
the victims have that in common .
so do i.
her father 's disappeared .
mom , thanks for stopping by .
what if there are others , henry ?
yeah , good .
more than that .
isn 't it nice ?
i 'm fed up .
he 'll be with me till the end because this is the only way forward , and eventually he 'll see this .

the hunger is still great , but people have developed courage .
energy .
i don 't think you 're the type of woman who does anything about his will .
and , derek , you just got your hand back .
oh , they 're celtic .

oh , are you serious ?
she 's a beauty .
i 'm terribly sorry .
we were there .
we were good together .

these gestures seem like motivational reflexes he does without knowing their symbolic meaning .
after that , every time ... even when we were fighting ... or i was mad at him because he forgot to trash the trash can or ... and i took a quick look at the tattoo , i remembered that guy loved me .
let go .
carol .
