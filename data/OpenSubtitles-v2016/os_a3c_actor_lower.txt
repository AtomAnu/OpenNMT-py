we 'll have the parents come .
what ?
a shower always works wonders .
the room 's upstairs .
- hey .
i expected that .
look , my new dog .
he 's in pain .
you tried to fuck me to get back to vic ?
- promise .

i want to go home , please .
- so you 're trying to bribe me ?
i think i was .
if you think i 'm your lover , you 're wrong .
- very well .
but every time the phone rings , he jumps around the house like crazy .
i know you live there , but i still have a funny feeling you 're following me .
honey ?
we 've lost everything !
- pull over to the side of the road .
by burning the journals .
- peter .
it 's a sort of obsession .
miss volkoff 's patience is exhausted .
i 've been thinking .
you down there , this is the police !
frankly , without offending anyone , it 's not wise for miss vega .
- you 're such a good daughter .
you should leave my house right now .
you 'll pay for this !
that 's the wronged mother who 's made a lot of mistakes .
even her star of the band had to go down even though he never did anything bad about her .
- whatever .
i advise you to be pragmatic .
- holy shit !

and a man .
but i changed , just like you did .
i 've only ever seen sisters .

my editor , raul , and his assistant , publicist .

never annoying , always warm .
it 's science .
we 've been looking all over for you .
i thought i deserved it .
somehow i was ...
now you must turn to your inner self .
grandfather , don 't distract .

and i thank all these students and parents for coming .
he calls them killers .
initiating descent .
i never left your side .
i forgot to pack mommy 's picture .
i 'm a terrible middle-aged man .

the top magician in vegas .
i 'm telling you guys ...

every ten seconds , an image is discarded until there 's only one left .
that selfish and cowardly man despised himself .

you seem like a really nice guy ...
oh , yeah .

she wants me to miss her .
the persians ' fleet have thousands .
they say that when you look death in the eye together , a connection becomes inseparable .

liv !
i 'm the one asking .
or a bank .
thief !
i can do without you .
we 'll drink it later .
- yeah , bummer .
no , no .
all right , let me guess .
- i 've worn boxer shorts for years .
more useful than taking naked pictures of butters .
that could be why lex was behind the kidnapping .
i knew it was a bad idea to go out with you .
what was wrong with you ?
i think if teachers looked like this when i was a kid , i might have stayed in school and made something of myself .
i 'll take your gun , but you 're not staying here .
hey , looking for someone ?
he burns , he burns .
- i 'll try .
he killed our son .
lucy , my dear , she didn 't get that in the novel , did she ?
- i don 't know .
no wonder , at 50 degrees in the shade , things dry up .

look out the window and think of death , children .
who ?
you mean these , right ?
nonsense .
i 'll give you another kiss !
they sent armed men after us .
they 're powering weapons systems directly into the gps .
these things surround us all the time .
that 's how the killer came into the house .
the leprechaun has his dick in the monkey 's ass , and morgan comes running in and says ,
slumber party led and you cried through it .
- we 'll protect you .
why would he do that after she tried to kill him ?
ah , good !
- who are you ?
come here , man .
what 's your excuse ?
shit !
it has to say , " this is no life . "
well , it 's just ...
where 's dubaku ?
oh , and how 's that ?
no .
come on .
i have no idea .
thank you .
- amen .
you 're lucky in life , huh ?
come on , settle down .
sophie !
finch .
all right , brother .
but there 's a guide in the matter .
instead of having another thanksgiving with our messed up families , we all come here and have a quiet , peaceful thanksgiving .
draw your apartment , julia .
are you kidding ?
i mean , i lied , i stole , and i blinded myself to the idea that i was still a good guy .
will you wake up ?
crazy .
- check the book .
hey , tara , see you ...
the guys at the table next to me specifically said what they liked about you .
do you know who that was ?
time 's up , dr. wade .

you okay ?
all right , so ...
you catch them , you catch them .
hello .
instead of your dead mother , i give you this shield .
it 's time for me to leave you .
i don 't know what that means , but i think i have the nicest thing you 've ever said to me .
you know , as a winner , you have to have a lot of money .
does this mean you knew mr. foley ?
he 's at st. benjamin 's hospital .
i can 't stop picturing the people sitting on it .
- but , but ...
- there 's plenty of bodies .
the fire almost burned down the whole house , my mom died in the flames .
you just lost faith in yourself .
throw it back .
what do you think , henry ?
now that you know , you 'll be returning to the joint chiefs .
it was idiotic to bring you here .
- which is ?
sober .
how pathetic .
at least you can watch them kill me .
i killed him .
if we lie , those particular nuances get more pronounced .
- no , you 're gonna die !
- don 't worry about me .
the victims have that in common .
so do i.
your father is missing .
mom , thanks for stopping by .
what if there are others , henry ?
yeah , good .
more than i 'd hoped for .
isn 't it nice ?
i 'm done .
he 'll be with me to the end because this is the only way forward , and eventually he 'll see that .

i 'm terribly sorry .
we were there .
we were good together .
even if the equipment is kept alive artificially .

these gestures seem like lightning-fast reflexes he carries out without knowing the symbolic significance .
after that , every time , even when we were fighting or i was angry at him for forgetting to put the trash can away or ... and i took a quick look at the tattoo , i remembered that this guy loved me .
let go .

meg wouldn 't do that .
they 're just making a quick move .
i treat you badly ?
