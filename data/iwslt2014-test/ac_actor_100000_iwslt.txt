And of course we all share the same encryption codes .
We 're all born .
We 'll run <unk> .
We have to face the possibility that we will all sing and dance <unk> .
But interesting is the unique <unk> of the <unk> , the most committed in the <unk> .
All these people , they teach us that there are other ways of driving other worlds , other people to jump off the <unk> .
And that 's a <unk> movie that can only be done with <unk> .
Imagine the mass of the world 's largest <unk> world , a world of <unk> and <unk> , which the world 's most important , as the most <unk> , is how you know , the <unk> .
The <unk> is the great <unk> of the <unk> .
She 's the least we could do .
And just as the <unk> became strong , this happened with the <unk> rolling along only with the larger <unk> .
and the chosen <unk> for that is the last of them .
As each of them was born in this room , as many as 6000 ;
Now , a sea turtle can 't just rule the <unk> , or a <unk> of <unk> .
a pocket watch is <unk> with the human brain .
It is a small world , medium , with the soul of a specific adult world .
Every grain of sand is like a <unk> 's <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> spiritual retreat .
And as we sit here today at <unk> , half of these <unk> are absolutely <unk> .
They won 't be taught anymore , which means that if nothing is done , they 're actually dead .
What could be so lonely , if you had to be quiet in the light of one of the last <unk> on your <unk> having no business arrangement to submit to any of the children 's <unk> , or are you expecting ?
and yet that horrible fate is actually starting to attached to someone on the <unk> , about all two <unk> , because every two <unk> , a <unk> woman dies , and the last <unk> with an older woman .
Let her be <unk> . "
And then they would suddenly realize how it would be if they couldn 't speak their own <unk> .
Which is why I would like to take her out to some extent drag her through the <unk> , a short journey to make them understand what actually went wrong .
Now there are some among us who may be forgetting that if I say " <unk> " , in a different way , really different version of the beam .
Take them as the Son of the <unk> in the Sacred College of Cardinals , the people of the people of the people believe they are bringing the holy <unk> of <unk> .
This is a people that can 't stand between the people of blue and green and green , since the <unk> that <unk> the people are equal , is equal to the people .
They have a strange <unk> of behaviour and a <unk> called the National Museum that they must marry someone else who speaks another Latin .
All this <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the strange <unk> of these great <unk> who , on the <unk> of the sixth or the seventh , are said , is that you 'll never hear the strangest one .
Just listen and then start talking .
or one of the most intelligent people I 've ever lived with , the most extraordinary people in the world of <unk> , an amazing people in the life of 1958 has been reported in their way .
<unk> tried to capture 5 <unk> <unk> and made a mistake .
They threw out of the <unk> , which we were as a friendly <unk> they forgot that these people had never seen anything in their administration .
... they picked up those <unk> from the <unk> , tried to see the <unk> , or the <unk> , found nothing , and <unk> that this might be the <unk> of the five <unk> <unk> and killed .
But the <unk> didn 't just kill <unk> with the <unk> .
They became <unk> each other .
54 % of the local experts were dead .
But at the same time , they had a clear <unk> of the <unk> that was amazing .
Their control figures could smell the quality of a field knife from 40 cow <unk> and determine which <unk> belonged to .
I had to , of course , have something to believe in this remarkable mass murderer , and <unk> is not a <unk> black hole .
The <unk> process is about a complex <unk> process .
It 's interesting .
What would they say ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , whatever .
An object of the disease is always going to remain , because the original layer of fog is that there is no <unk> , of course , and there is a purely religious werewolf theory , and that is all very <unk> while the <unk> of the <unk>
But what makes <unk> interesting is that living between the living rooms and the dead .
<unk> give birth to living corpses .
The <unk> can now be stepped on the <unk> period to answer for the <unk> 's passing of the living soul to the <unk> so that the overall door will be <unk> to the <unk> for one .
<unk> would love to say , " You white man walks into the perimeter , talking about God .
" and dancing in the blink of an eye . "
And because you are possessed , you will be taken by the Military Committee .
See these stunning <unk> in a <unk> built on a hot fudge planet without <unk> a surprising <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> that would affect the most extreme , if it continues to stand in place .

In a medicine club , the only people who have never been conquered by the <unk> .
... until today , they are ruled by a <unk> <unk> ... the <unk> tissues are most unusual .
and during all this time , they will be inserted into the formation of the community , ordering the <unk> to stay alive and only their cosmic rays , or <unk> that we could tell <unk> of that .
It 's so wonderful .
They call themselves the older <unk> , and say that we 're the younger races responsible for the <unk> of the world .
Now that the Civil War rules are very important .
So , <unk> are not sentimental , nor will they be weakened by the <unk> .
Well , what does that mean ?
Whether he 's a serial killer or a <unk> <unk> <unk> is irrelevant .
The interesting thing is , which defines the transfer between the <unk> and the <unk> .
I grew up in the <unk> of British high school , and I believed that those <unk> kids were becoming <unk> .
Now , when you start to look at the <unk> that can create the <unk> different types , you can understand some of their extraordinary ideas around here .
It 's a fallacy I took in the last <unk> of the <unk> .
This is <unk> heard of many of them . The strongest <unk> from the <unk> of the giant .
These <unk> contains some very strong <unk> that <unk> the <unk> and <unk> are very similar .
If they 've seen the <unk> once , how they create this energy beam , this power source , which it contains both false <unk> .
Finding that piece of face is about as being fired from a concentration camp on <unk> and soil contamination on a poisoning .
It will not be created by the <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> .
But the <unk> with the <unk> ... is that they can 't be taken ... by a jealous <unk> of a human being .
They can only be buried in <unk> with some other <unk> who are experiencing the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , the fascinating thing is that the <unk> in the <unk> are directly from the kind of guy who is required to question the <unk> .
How can this <unk> be developed from a <unk> giant <unk> giant <unk> giant these two <unk> who can 't even begin to exist in that , when combined with the <unk> , like all the <unk> pretending to be bigger than his <unk> ?
We use this great stone chamber , try and error as it turns out .
But when you ask the <unk> they say , " the <unk> speaks to us . "
So what does that mean ?
These <unk> , the <unk> , have 17 <unk> on <unk> , which they all see in the <unk> area that appear as some kind of <unk> .
And then they ask how they justify their actions and say , " I thought you understood something about it .
I mean , you know nothing at all ?
So , it turns out you 're taking on all of the <unk> at <unk> and singing it into a different <unk> .
Well , it doesn 't put them in <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> .
Now , the world 's problem is that even among us , the ones who have <unk> the difficult <unk> of the world as it , and in a way , they look at our <unk> , while it 's still lighter .
All the <unk> have gotten mixed up with the dance team .
And the problem is not technology .
The <unk> <unk> stopped being on <unk> when she stopped being <unk> and <unk> while the <unk> stopped being <unk> , as they passed along .
Not participate and defense agents are threatening the <unk> ceremony .
Or if we go to the <unk> of <unk> , where I 'm gonna spend a lot of time , you 're gonna see the <unk> of political <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> , the most <unk> human being , will be convict , but the most <unk> , the most <unk> , the most <unk> human being , will not only be celebrated , and joined as a representative .
And they can 't understand if they didn 't see it through solid objects .
" and father of this young <unk> , has been identified as the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> . "
That meant he was killed in the Chinese <unk> instantly .
His uncle got away with her check in the <unk> that got guys into <unk> .
his gun ship was locked up as a traffic warden for the <unk> good .
He was smuggled into the old two toys to hide under their robes , since they couldn 't live without him .
the <unk> that did this brave deed was taken into a galaxy age .
One fateful ski instructor , she stepped out on a hair sample , and she had to go to a weight training site for this very seven keys .
I know it 's hard for <unk> to suffer , but the <unk> liked that it was a little awkward .
and at the end of the world , we really want to live in a collective bargaining chip or in a <unk> of the <unk> world ?
and it 's humiliating to think that maybe our <unk> has existed for 600,000 years .
The <unk> <unk> that brought us the <unk> , and we sat on this <unk> moment in the creation of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , only through the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The world 's most advanced world we know is hardly 300 <unk> old .
Well , this lottery factory thing is telling me that we all have responded to the popular issues we are going to face in the coming civil war .

Here 's a champagne toast which I took on the north end of the <unk> when I went on the market with the <unk> and this man , well , he told me a wonderful fish Lucy .
Well , the Canadian <unk> isn 't always very well dealt with the <unk> and while the standard <unk> architecture attack on our <unk> , they were forced to move into <unk>
The <unk> that old <unk> refused .
the family that fear for his life took all of them <unk> and all of them .
Now they need to know that the <unk> are not afraid of the <unk> , they profit them , using their advantage .
originally buried in their DNA <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> , didn 't fear the <unk> <unk> night or the <unk> <unk> .
In the meantime , he made <unk> , <unk> out of <unk> , and <unk> into his hand , and when the <unk> began to freeze , he started them in the <unk> of a knife .
He was frozen on the <unk> acid , and when it was completely frozen , he stabbed to death with it .
He took a <unk> , took a <unk> , took the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> , and put a <unk> on the <unk> .
You can 't do anything like that .
and this is in many ways a <unk> world for the <unk> of the <unk> and all the <unk> on it .
Canadian Olympic <unk> gave the team leaders in the <unk> They put back complete control of a <unk> 1999 .
It 's our new name , <unk> .
They control all the support systems .
An amazing figure , like a Christmas parade , a street gang with <unk> can reach and reach .
and in the end , I think it 's pretty obvious , at least for those of us who 've traveled to the <unk> , to see that they haven 't gone at all .
They 're the most intelligent of them .
They represent the human <unk> , who live in the past , <unk> , and for all of us , are dreaming of the kids who are like our own children 's involvement of the children .
What we 're trying to do on national security is that we believe That <unk> will never reach anything .
We believe that <unk> rarely believe that <unk> is <unk> , but we believe that <unk> can change the world and that we are most likely to receive the best <unk> million in our district .
Send <unk> our landing party .
Our insurance books are read millions .
Thanks a lot .
We see many , many lines of digital videos here , which you play the " <unk> " and " <unk> " , anything else can be heard .
and it doesn 't matter how many magic bags we see are , how big they are , or how big they are .
Most of them are digital <unk> of a <unk> , but this one is for the kick in the ass , and it 's in a <unk> production of 300 .
It doesn 't matter , because the only thing that can limit the range of a <unk> like this is the identity of a struggle at any moment in your book .
This is a full <unk> , an example of girls ' rights .
This is <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
Now , to prove it 's really about a picture image and not a pose , we can do something like this to show that this is a real picture of the multiple choice and not a picture .
Maybe this is some kind of artificial personality .
I wouldn 't recommend it .
This is a <unk> case .
Well , every picture is the scale of a radiation field .
And that really gives them the pleasure and the good idea of reading a fake ID or a student 's or a <unk> , which is a <unk> of some kind .
We also made something special in the <unk> of the <unk> .
We designed a false panel with very high <unk> , which is much higher than a normal <unk> and we added extra <unk> .
If they want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , they can see them here .
Or other <unk> , or even technical <unk> .
and this is really picking up the <unk> , this gym thing for the evening at the <unk> lake .
We hope that doesn 't mean any <unk> and others <unk> - that shouldn 't be necessary .
Of course , the security is one of the most obvious concentration camps for technology like this .
and I really don 't want to spend a lot of time here except to tell you that we 're going to work on that <unk> .
But these are all the <unk> in the <unk> .
Ladies and gentlemen , the picture is now coming up .
Let 's get something else out of here .
This is actually live on <unk> .
This is a treaty with the <unk> <unk> that really ties two different <unk> .
One is an identity thief , and the other is a very good judge of tobacco <unk> , which is <unk> of <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> , among the <unk>
and <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> was done by a very clever <unk> .
So this is live in the <unk> - it 's powered by <unk> .
They can see that if we can create this copy of <unk> images that we can penetrate through and make those Including on separate occasions .
But the magic potion of these images is in this video file by giant spiders .
I don 't really know if I have time to show them any other <unk> .
There are some who are a lot of <unk> .
We had to worry about the loves things we did .
So this is all bullshit , and they all stand <unk> at these wisely .
And we can navigate that very simple .
You know , I never believed I was gonna be working at Pyramid .
I 'm very grateful for the <unk> .
I 'm guessing they can see that there are a lot of different <unk> from meth labs , and everything is up to the credit card bills , a pretty big photograph taken by all of them .
and if possible , I will find some of the strange ones .
Many of them have undercover <unk> .
There 's a reference here from <unk> - here they are .
This is actually a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that was recorded right .
We can switch from the <unk> to a physical <unk> of this <unk> .
This is here that we can do things with social <unk> , it will be <unk> by all nations of the collective to see how everything is connected to each other and everything looks connected .
All these lines are connected , and it becomes something bigger than sharing the blood sample .
It creates an incapacity to discharge the whole county hospital .
Look at this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that 's something used by the <unk> , the people that use it , and use it for <unk> to grow and grow even more rapidly .
Their own <unk> will be <unk> with <unk> <unk> who punched in other <unk> .
and , of course , <unk> all of this are the very definite <unk> of all the interesting subjects of which were not only held in terms of <unk> or <unk> and such .
Thanks a lot .
Do I understand it right ?
Yeah , she 's just making things known .
If they want to make it work .
And she 's doing this because of the smell in the <unk> .
And this is really exciting , when they think of the tucked away in the most of the oil industry .
Now , look how it contains a plastic box for images where it contains <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the which is it .
But how about a picture of her closing in with all her prints ?
Then the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the ingredients that make it really enormous , it 's a classic <unk> .
Congratulations , on the incredible amount .
Thank you very much .
I 'm gonna tell them some things from my <unk> they 're gonna tell me how I hope they 're in the drug business who you already heard , and I 'm gonna try to make them a couple of these , if they don 't notice .
I want to start with what I call " official <unk> " .
Would you like to review the official message ?
The official <unk> of all Western <unk> .
The official <unk> system works like this , when our target is the mission of the <unk> of our mission , this is mainly a <unk> session .
For this reason , <unk> is good in itself , valuable , useful , productive sex drive .
If <unk> had killed it , then it 's every one of us who does things for themselves that have to do with our <unk> and none of us have a choice .
The choice is to infiltrate <unk> .
the more <unk> the more <unk> they have and the more scalps they have , the more they have , the more they have .
This is , I think , through our embedded <unk> , that nobody would be able to argue with it .
And it is deeply rooted in our lives .
I will give you some of the key features that will allow us modern <unk> .
This is my <unk> .
I just want to say something about <unk> .
So that 's how the <unk> is .
And then they go to the <unk> temple for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> money , into a circus tent that way .
We can put in millions of different <unk> dresses from the <unk> that are offered into a company car seat .
They have to admit that 's a big <unk> .
In other worlds , the world of <unk> .
There was a time when I was a young kid , you could have any phone call you wanted from when he came to .
They rented her cellphone .
One phone call was that it was never broken .
Those <unk> are over .
Now we have almost an infinite political world of <unk> especially in the most basic world of the world .
These are the fangs of the eastern <unk> rattlesnake .
MY P.R. MAN IN THE <unk> <unk> <unk> AND <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if they haven 't seen that in their <unk> by now , they can be sure they 'll be soon .
And what it does is to have <unk> run into the <unk> and ask them .
Now you know what the <unk> is asking about ?
the dope 's " no . "
It 's not possible to buy a <unk> that doesn 't do too much .
In other Sanskrit <unk> , for that much more significant than the amount of <unk> , the same <unk> of <unk> .
--
Instead they go to the <unk> and the <unk> says that we could do one or we could .
A has this <unk> and <unk> .
With my own eyes ,
And they say , " <unk> , what should I do ? "
The bank manager says a bond has this faith and has rounded up and has the <unk> and the <unk> .
What are they gonna do ?
And when they say , " if they were me , <unk> , what would they do ? "
The fairy said , " but I 'm not her . "
There 's an endless source for people like you and me when they think about it , because we don 't buy them .
Why does she concern us if we can 't buy ?
The <unk> is they expect us to call the <unk> tomorrow and ask for a <unk> of the <unk> .
Something as amazing as our battle plans are now a matter of choice as to show these <unk> .
We don 't <unk> , we invent .
And we invent ways to make up .
That means that every day , when they wake up in the morning , they have to decide what kind of asshole they want to be .
In <unk> , before family , there was a time when there was a kids ' home that nearly got one and they got married as fast as they could , and then they got kids , and then they got married like babies .
The only real choice was " who , " not when , not what they were doing .
Everything is easy these days .
I teach beautiful intelligent services , and I give them 20 scenarios less than I used to .
And not because they 're less smart , and not because they 're less thorough .
Is it because she 's busy with other people , they 're wondering , " do I get married or not ?
Should I get married later ?
They 're all <unk> .
And they 're going to answer these questions as opposed to whether that 's going to mean all the <unk> I 've gotten to them and not get a good scrubbing in my trunk .
And that 's what they should do .
We are blessed to work , as <unk> <unk> has done , with the <unk> that allows us to work every day of every day on the planet except at the <unk> desk .
By the way , there 's a <unk> I 'm not gonna tell anybody that works for the video closet .
I 'm not gonna tell them because I want to use it .
So what it means to have this incredible file of choice in the book we have to go to work on <unk> , again and again , whether we should work or not .
We can play our little game of graduation exercises , and we 've got our <unk> <unk> on the one , and our <unk> <unk> , and our <unk> <unk> , and probably on our <unk> course .
And even if they 're all shut down , every minute we <unk> our guy in a <unk> moment , we wonder , should I take this <unk> ?
Should I answer to these vows ?
And even if the <unk> ask no , " it 's certainly going to be her reflection of the source of her <unk> material .
Everywhere we look , big things , small things , messy things , and then , you know , live one of them .
and the world we lived like this .
I 'm saying there were some decides to do it , but not all was one of them .
and the world we live on now looks like this .
And the questions are good or bad news ?
" yes . "
We all know what 's good about it , so I 'm gonna make this bad .
All these <unk> have two magnetic boats .
a <unk> , <unk> wise , is to relieve him of being paralyzing .
With so many choices of the people can choose , it 's very difficult to even decide .
I 'm going to give them another crazy idea for a <unk> on a domestic partnership .
a plastic surgeon on top of my list of <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million <unk> and about 2000 <unk> .
And what she found was ten years old at the center of the job center ... brought down the <unk> at 2 <unk> .
They offer 50 <unk> at 10 <unk> less time than offered them five .
Because it 's 50 days of hard to decide which one you choose to delay .
And then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , tomorrow never comes .
They don 't put through these <unk> till the end of $ 5,000 to the limit of a <unk> which would have been happy to breed their <unk> .
<unk> is one of the many follow .
and I think it 's the world that looks like this .
You really want to make the decision right if it 's for all the <unk> , right ?
They don 't want to choose the fake psychic powers or picking the wrong <unk> .
So this is the one <unk> - the other <unk> - that even if we can get past the <unk> , and then we have turned to a decision that we would not have had less fortunate than to decide between us .
And there are several times for this .
The more <unk> exist , the easier it is for the choice is to regret even that they meet .
Second , what <unk> call .
<unk> <unk> did a great night thing this morning ... when he told me how much of the kind of work we do .
Now , if there 's a lot of alternate , I think it 's just that you choose from an alternate plan that makes them less comfortable with the Pick them .
Right here , you know , for those of you who aren 't new people , I apologize .
But here 's what they should have thought .
There 's a couple on the <unk> .
That 's very expensive <unk> .
I 've got a beautiful day .
What could be better ? " He who thinks it 's <unk> .
Everyone in my power suit is gone .
I could park right in front of my account . "
And he 's two <unk> of the <unk> brothers that he missed the <unk> , over the next day , on a magnificent day .
Put down the oxygen scrubbers , which we gain by our <unk> , even if what we have is amazing .
And the more <unk> there to the <unk> , the more attractive <unk> of these <unk> are considered <unk> .
So here 's another example .
Well , this Flash is testifying .
He says that living through this now and maybe things get pretty close to him .
but an important thing he does to keep track of who she makes for an adult decision is not to do other people .
And these other things like a lot of attractive <unk> , and it 's gonna get them less attractive .
Third : <unk> of the <unk> .
This hit me when I was about to exchange my <unk> .
I wear <unk> , almost all the time .
So we went to buy new Apple products after many <unk> of the old one , and I said , " I 'd like to have some of my bags now . "
And the <unk> said , " do they want <unk> , light <unk> or long ?
Do you want to go <unk> or dried <unk> ?
Do you want <unk> with <unk> ?
Looking down , blah , blah , <unk> , and so on he told me .
My <unk> was downstairs , and after I recovered , I said , " I would like the kind of guy who used to be the only , kind of guy . "
He didn 't have any <unk> what it was , so I spent a <unk> event so that everybody left these fucking <unk> <unk> , and I say the best match with the <unk> I ever had .
I had better , all this <unk> <unk> that made me feel better .
but I felt worse .
Why ?
The reason I felt worse ... with all these available powers of <unk> ... my stomach content ... leaving me in a good mood , went up .
I had very low <unk> I had no degrees <unk> when it was just in some kind of guy .
When they came into 100 <unk> ! One of them should have been perfect !
And what I got was good , but it wasn 't perfect .
And so I cross-referenced what I got to what I was expecting , and what I was , what I was , compared to what I expected .
... which would also value the <unk> 's <unk> ... have stretched over as well as these <unk> .
And this leads to fewer <unk> with the <unk> even if the <unk> are good .
No one in the world 's world knows this , because if they did , they wouldn 't know what it 's all about .
The <unk> is more like this .
The <unk> , which used to be better than anything was worse than anything worse , it was possible for the <unk> to make a happy collection .
Today , in the world where we live , we grew up , <unk> <unk> by <unk> as the finest <unk> can ever hope for .
They will never improve because their performance records are my favorite , <unk> .
These <unk> to the <unk> , that 's what they all came for . The <unk> to the low <unk> .
I would like to say a brief <unk> - that I am married to a woman , and she is very wonderful .
I couldn 't have done better .
But still , it 's not always such a bad trip around here .
When hundreds of different species are free of <unk> , and they buy one that 's disappointing , and they ask why who 's responsible ?
It is also clear that the <unk> are asking for it :
They could have done better .
With 100 different light conditions in the <unk> area , there 's no excuse for error .
and so , if <unk> is dating , and even if the <unk> of the <unk> are good , they feel disappointed themselves , that they are <unk> .
THE LAST <unk> <unk> IN THE WORLD IN THE <unk> <unk> .
and that is the stupidest thing that we have in general ... better , and we feel worse .
So let me remind her .
This is the official business decision that we all think is right , completely wrong .
There 's no question that this is better than no one , but it 's not following , which is more <unk> than anything .
There 's a lot of magic .
I 'm pretty sure we 've missed this long proposal from the Center line .
Now , as a <unk> ask , I was nearly ready to be taken off as a <unk> to think about the <unk> tension that allows all those <unk> to think about .
There are many world worlds in the world , and we have heard of many of them whose problem is not too great .
Her problem is they don 't have enough .
So things I 'm talking about are a far more modern , handing out the west <unk> .
And what 's so frustrating and so annoying is <unk> <unk> told them about how much that costs and how hard it 's not helping <unk> .
What I 'm telling you is these expensive , <unk> <unk> thing is not easy to help .
They even hurt .
They 're making us look bad .
If something was made by the people of our community to visit such <unk> with the <unk> in which it would not only be altered , but that would also be improved .
<unk> call this a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> will make sure that we all do not pick up the poor just because all those great big <unk> are leaving us .
<unk> , can you read this <unk> and a grow <unk> , say , " What does this <unk> ?
They know nothing possible in this dump . "
<unk> <unk> , a world leader , and that 's the kind of art that I read first .
The more I look over it , the more I came to the <unk> , the <unk> knows something .
Because the <unk> is that if they break the <unk> , that anything is possible , they have no <unk> .
If she breaks down the <unk> , as much as possible , sink the <unk> .
Lower the <unk> and lower the <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is close to <unk> <unk> <unk> , possibly bound for the <unk> , definitely for us .
But that 's what 's missing from a <unk> basketball team ... leaving a terrible food supply in the poor , and I suspect , <unk> .
Thank you very much .
You know , I 've talked about some of the <unk> before , about the human <unk> and what that could mean , and about the <unk> new <unk> .
In fact , we start off from a new look , we have the motion sensors wheels , and now we 're trying to start by creating a new line of water flow through the sea air .
We 've always been tempted to ask more significant questions .
It 's something I think that a lot of test subjects have been trying to understand and this on different reservation .
We 've tried different animal tests to simplify it to the <unk> <unk> .
We have nearly 20 tradition of entering the globe , as we have gathered the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> People 's Liberation Army .
Now we 're trying to ask if we can live or try to recover our new life from this digital nightclub ?
These are the <unk> of a small <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who has the smallest <unk> position in their own <unk> system , and we are trying to match that with a smaller , low <unk> brain .
We made it about a hundred worth of <unk> from the 500 or so , they 're here .
Therefore , we have decided that the only way to further away is this <unk> actually allowed us to <unk> the individual <unk> and <unk> some of these <unk> .
And so we started asking about it , can we <unk> a <unk> ?
Does the <unk> make this really big <unk> story that never was made before ?
And if we can , we can start the locker search .
a <unk> robot is just a <unk> organic <unk> .
our best feature in the <unk> of the <unk> were <unk> .
<unk> our genetic <unk> has developed slowly but it has now developed <unk> , and yet , our last <unk> would have put on a proper looking list .
We started this before 15 .
It actually took some dancing lessons to a <unk> Before we made the first <unk> .
Turns out <unk> is very difficult .
There are laser technology all around the world that can make little <unk> of <unk> 30 to 50 <unk> but it 's one hundred times more <unk> , so the more you make a mistake .
So we had to devise a new technique with which we could together these small <unk> and correct the mistakes .
This was our first attempt , <unk> with the digital chip , from the <unk> x <unk> .
It 's a small <unk> of the <unk> kill .
We built a small group of young <unk> , and had a <unk> of about 5000 <unk> .
<unk> arrived when we took this <unk> <unk> <unk> and put it into an exciting sales competition , and the cancer genes started to read and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> were then cleared by the <unk> and came back and killed <unk> .
Recently , I spoke to the <unk> and they said that they were actually tearing up this theirs .
She laughed more than you do here .
So we think that this is a government matter in the <unk> system actually built their own <unk> in a biological system .
<unk> is the key , and if you start <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , that <unk> doesn 't really have to be a digital .
When we first created the world in 1995 , the <unk> at a 10,000 <unk> .
We found original <unk> agreed that if we used the <unk> , it would never have been possible .
Coming through with a play is to make the 50 <unk> are long and those with other <unk> need to build smaller ones to make a match for them .
We installed unique <unk> here .
They might have heard we installed some <unk> .
Think about it , we have a positive return , a happy c , and don 't think so .
These <unk> <unk> passed this <unk> <unk> , about 20 <unk> , and there 's a single <unk> for each of these <unk> .
So we can use genetic <unk> to write our brain scans , weather reports .
We only signed it .
Some people were disappointed that it wasn 't a <unk> film .
We designed the <unk> so that we could chop it up with <unk> tools and fix these <unk> .
And we started making <unk> , we started <unk> , <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> , until we could patch together those <unk> to put this everyone back together until <unk> .
In each way , we <unk> these <unk> off at the <unk> so we could drift them off 'cause we tried to create a very <unk> path they 'll see in a minute .
We were trying to get to the <unk> on site .
So , this looks like a funeral procession .
If we can get to that really great big <unk> with over 100,000 <unk> then those <unk> won 't just grow in <unk> it 's all the offspring that we need .
We knew about a death threat to the <unk> <unk> <unk> commonly called the <unk> ... using to fix the <unk> , which can <unk> those .
Now , here 's a cut of it , and there 's a <unk> named <unk> <unk> <unk> who can stand 3 million <unk> .
They 're looking at the top of the building that his penis drug runner is just falling apart .
12 to 24 <unk> later , everything <unk> together as it was .
We have thousands of capital <unk> that can do that .
These <unk> can become totally dry , they can even live in the process of <unk> .
I 'm absolutely certain that living in the <unk> can exist and move on who 's looking for <unk> .
Actually , the <unk> showed there are a lot of them out there .
Now , here 's a plastic version of the <unk> we used by using this <unk> - actually , we used <unk> with the right amount of <unk> that we put them together .
This isn 't a <unk> it 's a regular working relationship .
It 's such a big <unk> that we can even see it with the <unk> .
<unk> over a <unk> of six <unk> .
This is the men we recently finished .
They 're over <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
It has a system of over 300 million .
If we had to print it out with a <unk> of 10 and not <unk> 142 it would be <unk> <unk> to blow over this planet .
Now , how do we launch a fire drill ?
It 's obvious that it 's very simple with a <unk> .
It 's also easier if you 're in <unk> like we are , you just take out the robot toy and send someone else inside , and that 's exactly what they all heard about .
The treatment room 's the <unk> in the containment fields , but recently we 've been <unk> a complete set of energy wave from a <unk> line to the other one and can activate these .
The new <unk> went to the <unk> .
Actually , we thought this was the end , but we were trying to get the <unk> a little further .
This is the tenderloin of hash !
We find all the financial groups from <unk> who took a second mortgage or a third of a third of them took a thousand of them to nothing but a <unk> Four .
So people who imagine <unk> as a human being turned on to a <unk> that 's been missing much from the golf course .
There are <unk> of the <unk> that are actually <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the central line , not one we added the extra .
It was reported in the <unk> People 's Liberation Army and white personally , and so on top of that , we ended up with a new war problem .
The <unk> were attached to the <unk> .
And after a very short time , it had lost all traces of the <unk> and <unk> complete <unk> on a new <unk> wall that we have put on the <unk> .
All the <unk> change of memory <unk> while we touched the genetic <unk> , it was exactly what we saw .
It may sound like learned little from these things but we can move on just by moving the <unk> things around , pretty much change .
Now I 've argued that this isn 't the <unk> Code opened up to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I argued that we may be <unk> a new technique resolution to create the <unk> <unk> that it could be the new <unk> based on that digital camera .
Why would we do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious what we need in the settlement .
We 're about to make out of <unk> <unk> to the next 40 <unk> underground .
In fact , in my case , I was born in ' 1946 .
Today , three people are on this planet for every county in 1946 , and in 40 of 40 <unk> it will be four of <unk> .
We 're having trouble resetting the EPS <unk> with <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for <unk> .
It will provide a <unk> for nine .
We need over five <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> million <unk> per day .
If we think about biological <unk> or some <unk> virus , it will be a giant <unk> .
Then , of course , there 's the whole <unk> thing that lands in the <unk> .
We now have , from our most personal world , a <unk> company with about 20 million <unk> , and I want to believe that the <unk> people are the most promising .
The <unk> had a dozen <unk> , and they look into the soil contamination .
We drink first of war Here , the <unk> of the biological and those of our <unk> .
Today we have <unk> because of this rapid regeneration device to do what we call <unk> .
We now have the <unk> to build a large millions of dollars from <unk> to day .
If they 're imagining this 20 million <unk> or those <unk> <unk> to manufacture <unk> or <unk> new <unk> , we can only make more <unk> than the last 20 <unk> .
and it 's just <unk> <unk> .
This is a beacon of light we 're working on that we 're actually sitting down with and making new <unk> at the park table .
You know , we don 't necessarily look like it .
We will now focus on the fourth amendment 's energy wave .
They 've recently seen <unk> radiation which is just a bad sign .
We have <unk> of the <unk> and three <unk> who soon come out of the way are going to much higher up , like <unk> <unk> or different <unk> clubs .
But , as we think , the only kind with this kind of <unk> is gonna cost a big shot with no more debt attached to the <unk> or the effects of <unk> their <unk> , is when we go down and see those <unk> ,
and we think we 're gonna be the first ones to enter the <unk> , and in about 18 <unk> .
<unk> AND <unk>
But in our world 's greatest love life , we all have different <unk> parties .
This is a <unk> we described back in 1996 .
He lives in the <unk> area , near <unk> miles , near <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> in <unk> to rule among the <unk> of <unk> .
We 're looking into <unk> <unk> DNA that could be taken to <unk> DNA , <unk> the <unk> drug factory in order to run this trial program .
In a brief <unk> , we believe that we may be the most basic question of solving the very basic problem .
You know , we did really tap <unk> 's targets like the <unk> of the entire continent , if you couldn 't do that at <unk> , where else would be <unk> ?
But right now we 're working on using the same encryption codes for the <unk> of <unk> .
They 've seen that <unk> with the <unk> , we 're always a <unk> in the back , and we 've got a little extra , if it comes down to the right .
I think that 's gonna be changed by creating <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
It is what the <unk> may look like with potentially <unk> could be accelerated today in the market light of the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , possibly <unk> .
We are not far from human beings , but our goal is to have a power struggle to survive this long enough to last .
On the last months of training , I had a chance to make a home improvements .
And I promised to come back and explain to them how the <unk> works .
So now it 's time and for all those who didn 't show up at the time , the most learned team of <unk> has ever been turned on .
His real name is to create the <unk> which is less than one <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and the 600 in a million <unk> .
It 's just breathtaking ambitious .
This is the food court below <unk> .
Let 's put these pictures on <unk> .
This is the one I work for .
Now , here is a picture of the picture frame in the <unk> so they can see the picture .
The last ten years of training has gone too far .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It caused nerve damage in the <unk> .
It is a picture of the first picture of which <unk> the entire case , then deliberately , by operating a <unk> of the Nobel Prize for Air Force .
Now , in other cases , when we saw this picture on the 10th mountain , we knew the <unk> was working , what a big train .
I don 't know if this created the largest cash flow or the one that was visited by the <unk> and the <unk> .
It means that we have reached an cultural shell with the scientific method .
about a <unk> later , there was a problem with the <unk> crew that was associated with these <unk> ,
These corporations sometimes run exposed <unk> <unk> when they run <unk> .
Well , the <unk> among them will look at them and say , " No , they 're not , they 're <unk> . "
They can afford it because when you push them very far , they become called <unk> .
So at <unk> right now , colder than the room in between the <unk> can withstand the <unk> .
In one of the <unk> <unk> between <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> .
And the only way to heat it up is to run out of carbon monoxide and find that the Ambassador has suddenly met <unk> <unk> .
This was the <unk> .
Now , this is all even more impressive when it feels that the laser is 20 <unk> and has shifted around 30 inches .
So we roll in about 50 of the sea air
and had to remove what we did .
We <unk> them , <unk> them .
They 're all gone now .
At the end of protocol , the <unk> will be back .
We 're gonna turn it on , and we 're gonna wait for the first date at the marine reception , get to know what the <unk> are like .
Well , of course , on some kind of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of <unk> , it 's so easy to refuse .
I think the <unk> is so difficult , the <unk> are reaching beyond our <unk> , worthy of the spectacle ,
Thanks a lot .
I 'm <unk> .
Writing is my <unk> , of course it 's more than that .
It 's also my big ... <unk> life and <unk> .
And I don 't expect this to ever change .
Although , <unk> is more common in my life and my pamphlet , which has helped me to rethink my While working completely .
The most worthy is that I , no matter where I come , treated as if I were <unk> <unk> .
Serious - the North Koreans .
You know , they 're all worried about me , saying , " Don 't fear that they 're never gonna <unk> that dick ?
They 're not afraid they 'll live up to their whole lives , and never create a power vacuum that nobody cares about in the world ?
Okay , that really makes <unk> .
People said that <unk> are not afraid to have <unk> ?
Aren 't you afraid the <unk> will kill you ?
Aren 't you afraid that you 'll live long to the bitter and miserable , and the fact that you 'll never dream of dying on a wooden stake with your vision of life ?
Sort of , you know .
<unk> the short 's- - the answer to all these questions is :
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those fear .
I always had that .
And I 'm afraid of much more evil than anyone would know .
I don 't know .
But if it 's about writing , I 've been thinking about it for a while , and I wonder why ?
Is that reasonable ?
Is it logical for someone to expect him to work on the work he wished to do ?
And what exactly is it with the creative <unk> that they make us insecure <unk> above our <unk> - in some kind of way , like other people don 't do ?
My father , for instance , was <unk> and I can 't remember a <unk> in his <unk> as a <unk> pro , asking if he was gonna be careful .
With your <unk> , <unk> - how 's it going ?
It just didn 't happen , you know ?
But to be fair - - the <unk> of the <unk> have not been given the call of any <unk> <unk> .
We seem to have this kind of a call , but not only the <unk> , but the creative one who seemed to have the call of the number , very smelly .
All they have to do is to look into the bitter ... of really great heads alone from the 20th college ... and often died of your own .
and even those who did not actually commit <unk> seemed properly neglected by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> told me right before his <unk> in his last known home owner had killed me a little further .
An extraordinary entity which could make her above her position .
The people I 'm asking everyone here today is that these wedding rings are completely <unk> ?
Are you comfortable with this ?
I find them despicable .
And I find her dangerous , and I don 't want to watch her get taken over to the next military academy .
I think it 'd be better if we were to live our big creative <unk> .
and I definitely know that it would be for me in my <unk> - very dangerous , sort of start this dark <unk> - especially in the projection room .
I 'm only about 40 years old .
I may have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it is most likely , the whole world I 'm about to write about now , as the work that 's being valued in this new world , right ?
I 'm telling it now , because we 're all kind of <unk> - it 's most likely that my greatest <unk> is behind me .
Oh , Joshua , what a <unk> !
These are the kind of asshole <unk> who can get someone to start breakfast at 9 a.m. , <unk> , and I don 't want to .
I 'd rather keep doing this work I love .
So she 's asking how ?
after quite some time of the football game , it seems to me that I can continue to write , some kind of psychological intimacy has to be <unk> .
Somehow , from now on , I need to find a way to write down a secure military line between me and my very natural <unk> about how the <unk> will be .
This one put me in the old <unk> and old <unk> .
If you will follow me , the <unk> will close up .
But in ancient <unk> and <unk> did not think <unk> was coming , okay ?
They believed that <unk> was some kind of divine <unk> ... who came from some distant country .
The <unk> refer to this divine <unk> of divine <unk> <unk> .
<unk> has been known to believe he had a <unk> who would have continued his way of <unk> .
The <unk> had the same kind of social security number ... called this <unk> <unk> <unk> culture ... a social services company .
The <unk> didn 't really think that a <unk> young lady was a particularly clever <unk> .
This is brilliant - it 's brilliant , there 's the most brilliant work I 've been talking about - the psychological profession that followed you to your work .
and everybody knew it worked that way , right ?
The <unk> of the <unk> was protected , like , too much , right ?
If your work was brilliant , you couldn 't take a look at everything for yourself , everybody knew you had that business that helped you .
Your work is not your fault , is it ?
Everybody knew your <unk> was a little lame .
It 's how the <unk> used to think about <unk> for a long time .
It 's the <unk> of the <unk> Fair and the human race began to believe that <unk> came from its own <unk> .
For the first time in the history of basketball , you hear this <unk> or the <unk> calling it a <unk> instead of having a <unk> .
I have to tell them I think that was a big mistake .
It 's like asking someone to swallow the beer bottles .
and distorted and all the creepy <unk> , and it creates all these holographic <unk> on the <unk> .
I think that <unk> destroyed our communications array from the last 500 <unk> .
and , if that 's true , and I think it 's true -
Can we change it ?
Perhaps to an expert opinion on why the <unk> forces and returning the creative one .
Maybe not .
Maybe we can 't just obliterate the <unk> from 500 <unk> rational states
And there 's certainly a <unk> in this <unk> person who would express an excellent scientific goodwill toward the <unk> god <unk> human rights programmed to continue their <unk> and their <unk> .
I probably won 't be able to bring all of them to this ride .
But the one I want is why not ?
Why don 't you think about it ?
Because it does as much <unk> as any other person I 've heard of when it comes to explain the thoroughly insane <unk> of the creative abilities .
a trade officer who 's acting like everybody knows who ever tried to do something , so in other people 's <unk> - not everybody 's right here .
In which he sometimes felt <unk> .
She said it was like a <unk> <unk> from <unk> ,
The one about the land on her would land .
She felt when it came because it would take the <unk> to her health care room .
She knew that she could only do one of these days , and that was in her daily run like hell .
And then there was this <unk> - the part I 'll never forget - she said there was <unk> in which she missed almost .
She caught the <unk> on his <unk> coat and moved it back to her <unk> and took it back to the <unk> .
These deaths , they had the health plan , and they were hooked on the <unk> - but - from the last Monday afternoon back to the beach .
When I heard that , I thought <unk> was intense - that 's exactly how my creative writing works .
It 's not like the creative <unk> - I 'm not the <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> to work , I have to get up every day and , uh , cheer myself up and really uncomfortable .
But even I , in my experience , sometimes I 've got this thing figured out .
And I guess a lot of them did that .
I even had a job or a pharmaceutical company that can identify from a <unk> who I really can 't identify .
What is this ?
and how do we step into <unk> without losing understanding of it , but to even keep us in the throes of amnesia ?
To me , the best man alive is to indulge in the customary <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Most of his favorite <unk> was the <unk> of the modern <unk> , the one who tried to control these creative <unk> and creative <unk> in them .
But then he got older and calmer , and he told me that he was going on a shopping expedition in <unk> , and because everything changed for him .
He has no <unk> <unk> , he has no <unk> , he has no <unk> .
So he starts to climb that old <unk> up in him like <unk> I 'm gonna lose this piece and be haunted by this song forever .
I 'm not good enough , I can 't make it .
Instead of getting into <unk> , he just stopped .
He shut down all that work and did something completely new .
He looked into the sky and said , " Sorry , can 't you see that I drive <unk> ? "
Do I look like I can just write a song ?
If you truly want to exist , come to a moment when I can take care of you .
If not , somebody else will be today .
Go <unk> <unk> <unk> .
His entire wedding march changed after .
Not the work itself , she 's always been as dark as ever .
Could be a <unk> , <unk> , bizarre <unk> , some kind of <unk> between <unk> and the cool <unk> that wasn 't completely <unk> .
When I heard the <unk> , it changed a little bit of the kind that I worked , and it saved me once .
Not just bad , but the worst of <unk> .
I was starting to think I should just tap the main thing .
but then I remembered how <unk> was in the open sky and I tried .
So I picked up my image from the empty table and I spoke my hotel room at an empty table of hotel .
I said , listen to me , you and I both know , if this <unk> isn 't brilliant , it 's totally my fault , right ?
Because you see , I have everything I have , and I have no more than that .
So if you want it better , you have to follow this and keep your <unk> of the foul play .
Okay , but if you don 't ... you know what ?
I 'm gonna keep writing because this is my job .
And I would like to <unk> that I was here today for my benefit of the doubt .
... at the end ... it 's like a person who 's willing to go out to the gates of ... with holy <unk> ... and peaceful til after the sea crowd .
These people were always great because the <unk> were professional and they were fantastic .
But every once in a while , it was rarely , something special happened .
And I know they know what I mean , because I know they 've all been living in one of those <unk> before .
It was as if time passed and the time line through a thousand kind of <unk> - he didn 't do anything differently than he ever did before , but everything got combined .
And all of a sudden , he didn 't show up more human .
He was recognised from the inside and from the bottom , and everything fell through a roof .
When something happened back then , they knew what it was .
They tied the <unk> together and started to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God .
That 's God , you know ?
When a <unk> in <unk> something <unk> , something magic did , <unk> , <unk> , magnificent , super , super , super , super <unk> , great !
And that 's great because we need this .
But , the fun part moves in the next morning when the <unk> wakes up , and sees it 's 11 <unk> on a main <unk> - and he 's no longer a God himself .
He is merely a <unk> <unk> lord with <unk> kneel , and perhaps he will never rise to those <unk> again .
And maybe no one will ever call <unk> again if he turns , but what will he do with the rest of his trip ?
This is hard .
It 's a creative <unk> of an <unk> .
But maybe it won 't have to be as full of <unk> if they didn 't believe the <unk> of their <unk> .
If they only think they 're a serial killer from a <unk> machine for an extended period of time on their own people , when they 're done with it .
When we start thinking about it , that changes everything .
So I started to think , and so I think with <unk> in the past , while I worked on the losing team , it 's gonna be as dangerous as my <unk> carrier .
What I have to tell myself , when I 'm crazy about it , it 's no big deal .
Don 't be a coward .
Just take your job .
Keep being there for your <unk> , whatever it is he is .
When your job is dancing , dance .
If that foolish act of faith , when it is you who is happily chosen for a moment of joy , <unk> by thine adorable , <unk> !
And if not , you can still dance your dance .
<unk> <unk> !
I believe in it , and I feel like we should teach it .
<unk> <unk> !
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> !
This is the last one where I showed these two <unk> to shoot down that the whoa million <unk> have been nearly <unk> million .
But that doesn 't push enough to push the spread of this big metal trophy case because it doesn 't show the special kind of <unk> .
In central Europe is the <unk> <unk> <unk> of our global economy .
it grows in the <unk> , shrinking in the <unk> .
The next candidate I 'll show them is a <unk> thing that happened at the last 25 <unk> .
The <unk> is marked with red .
As you can see , it is growing on the <unk> <unk> , this is the annual income of the <unk> <unk> and it is shrinking in the <unk> .
The <unk> , <unk> old or older ... is almost like the blood from this courtroom .
It 'll be here in 25 hours .
Now , this is a problem , since the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the giant <unk> giant <unk> where there are important solar flare activity when he 's done to <unk> <unk> .
Well , compared to the whole surveillance planning on staying at <unk> , that <unk> could double at the mercy if we were passing this critical moment .
Already in some shallow air ... <unk> <unk> ... <unk> by himself from the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> is with another low , shallow visit to another flat former <unk> .
Whoa !
She 's fine , the question is how will we let her go .
and a champagne toast is this enormous motion picture taken out of the <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> are bigger than ever .
This is <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
If they want to know how the air supply rises through here , they 're going to <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> .
At the end of the planet , the <unk> , the largest fleet truly effective on this planet .
Now , the final report of military intelligence sources confirm that the entire Klingon government has a negative power supply .
and the mountain caves that passed over a couple of <unk> appeared , especially high in the melting .
This is the same age as the <unk> <unk> .
At the firing range , the <unk> Building , they see new <unk> being up in front of a few <unk> .
Most <unk> on the world 's population receive half of its <unk> from this castle .
In the Magic Mike strippers , this sausage is the key to these <unk> .
The <unk> have <unk> .
But if she bites , most of the likely <unk> will go .
In <unk> a <unk> 40 <unk> of the <unk> ' weapons .
This concerns the <unk> .
and the <unk> , as you read , are serious .
This world 's nuclear energy supply is running to an unstable world .
And the world 's second largest <unk> crew , has never put a foot in a <unk> drain before .
four times as many as the last 30 <unk> as in the <unk> 75 .
This is a completely <unk> war .
If they look at this in the historical paper , they can see what it does .
Over the last five decades of <unk> we have made 70 million phone calls to <unk> each and every 24-hour restaurant of <unk> each .
Looking at the <unk> system on the eastern <unk> system exactly , from the American <unk> west <unk> and <unk> of the Indian Empire where there 's a deposit switch in the <unk> .
This is the biggest <unk> battle of <unk> <unk> , next to <unk> , who makes 20 <unk> of mass <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is the biggest problem .
The <unk> are one of the two main targets , along with the <unk> .
and the <unk> was to build many more <unk> .
but we begin to see a female body .
These are the ones that have been painted in this past <unk> with some yellow green suggested .
There is a political hole in our country .
and <unk> and <unk> paid a <unk> dollar bill last year to <unk> clean house .
This picture reminded me of something .
<unk> running around , <unk> at my place , a stuffed animal cage ...
They probably saw it in the <unk> .
This is on our entire land of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This happened to <unk> .
One of the most powerful people on the <unk> was that one .
<unk> of the <unk> is a happy , happy <unk> .
He has it in <unk> and in <unk> , and he helps our <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> is getting every day .
He 's adorable and adorable , and <unk> remain in <unk> and teasing .
This is the most crucial zone in all respects .
One of the most powerful <unk> is one of <unk> 's most powerful <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , they don 't know what they 're talking about .
So the Alliance called for <unk> two began living .
This is a part of her .
We 'll have <unk> look more serious than a serious <unk> for our food situation .
Which is why we <unk> it to the senior <unk> - a sizable <unk> craft to put the <unk> on the ones to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> is not dirty .
We think she 's clean and smells nice , too .
So , don 't worry about the <unk> .
Leave it to us .
<unk> <unk> , they 've heard a lot about it .
So let 's make a <unk> of this modern , clean getaway car .
This flat is getting loud .
But it was the <unk> , clean slate .
and yet , the <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> is for the global oil well worth the hundreds of years that see here , everything changes .
Look closely , this is today 's clean <unk> .
At last the positive alternative submarine <unk> with our commercial group <unk> and our <unk> of the National Guard .
A military coup is in a National Intelligence Committee , National damn it .
The red <unk> that connects us to the <unk> <unk> <unk> as dirty and <unk> <unk> .
But now there is a brave , new horizons , to get us out of this mess .
<unk> 100 <unk> of pure <unk> corn , within the next ten <unk>
Plan to bring <unk> back to work should make us safe and help us stop the global confusion .
Finally , a problems big enough to resolve our problems .
They find out more .
This is the last one .
It 's a <unk> of <unk> .
One of the fastest , <unk> , our world 's dirty , disgusting , disgusting <unk> to abort .
<unk> is here .
New pension fund to get well spent .
<unk> <unk> , it 's time to embrace <unk> .
There 's an old Klingon heart , " if you want to be fast , go alone .
If you want to go far , go together . "
We need to get far and fast .
Thanks a lot .
I want to start asking them to <unk> the time they played with <unk> .
While they realized how to repair the warp power packs and drive the <unk> and move the <unk> , they actually learned to understand , and figure out a way to change the balance of power relays .
The <unk> are very closely connected to how we understand a <unk> of our <unk> .
These <unk> thus disturb us that we have decided to become the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
In short , a <unk> is a <unk> drug compound in the <unk> of a toy .
They can be moved with the hand , they can hold on to each other , they can hold up their cargo hold , and they 've got a chest tray and a <unk> .
More importantly , is physically , which is why you can only put them through <unk> and move them .
and the <unk> are a glimpse of a new school experience from <unk> to broadcast schools .
and if these <unk> become obsolete , and the sea government can become a sea otter and begin to recognize each other , our <unk> with them , then we can start with the <unk> and the <unk> .
I 'm starting with some simple <unk> .
This <unk> goes forward for the con process , and if I shoot him in a <unk> , the play will move forward if I shoot him backwards in the other direction , it goes backwards .
And those surveillance photos are committed to each other .
So if I put them next to each other , that 's what you call a cab .
When they 're surrounded by <unk> , they can see that and get a little nervous .
and they feel the same way their <unk> and <unk> .
An interesting following of the members of the press investigation we began to see that we could put together a test of sleep <unk> as well as <unk> does about this rather than draw pain .
In that case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , and I can use it to pour water Into the <unk> where it 'll be mixed .
If we overdo this , we can do some <unk> .
There are also some nice alligator <unk> at the <unk> , like talking , or <unk> , where we need to give the <unk> of the plague and the <unk> want to see it now .
Here I am ... this is a programme I am with a simple handkerchief .
This is a play with <unk> who 's some kind of <unk> <unk> and some kind of <unk> .
In principle , usually you get a fresh start on every <unk> <unk> <unk> , and while you 're trying to form protective services , they are being vetted by a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds of speech , you 're gonna be <unk> again , and you 've got to try a new <unk> and new <unk> .
Thanks a lot .
These are some kids that came into a video store at the <unk> center .
They really loved it .
An interesting commercial on this kind of <unk> is that you don 't have to give the <unk> a lot of muscle <unk> .
All you have to say is " <unk> " and they know exactly what to do .
There are a few people here who test it .
That 's our youngest <unk> right there .
Turns out he only wanted to make the <unk> a hundred .
So they were just <unk> for him .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
We wanted to create an area of youth .
This is <unk> .
He can bring new <unk> into the <unk> by presenting the <unk> of the <unk> that shows these facts .
This is where he makes the <unk> .
THE <unk> ARE <unk>
Now he 's getting a <unk> into the <unk> .
The orange <unk> .
Good work !
By <unk> his wrists and Turn them next to each other , he can develop the <unk> -
... invent his own entertainment system .
Hello !
It 's a girls ' business at the end and he can decide how it 's working .
Flying <unk> !
The last candidate for what I 've had this time to show , is a time machine for <unk> , that we recently developed , and in the <unk> as <unk> , how <unk> and <unk> .
Each has four different ways to choose which you want to use .
and you can practice these wedding things in the <unk> you can also order for <unk> .
and you eat it by just holding a hand job at a family dinner .
there are wave tunnels that can change live like <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
You connect it with a particular subject and then hire it to the station .
and then , even more amazing <unk> like <unk> and <unk> ... that you 've <unk> to the entire starship commander .
Let 's see .
We begin in which we order the <unk> <unk> in two <unk> ... and order those in a <unk> ... they expand a little bit more .
Now I add a <unk> .
Now I 'm going to do a little bit of the dance .
and now I 'm going to connect the <unk> with the <unk> so I can pilot the <unk> live .
I can speed up all the <unk> by <unk> the <unk> into one or other <unk> .
and now I 'll connect the <unk> with the <unk> ; for a little more <unk> .
I can rearrange the used game as it works .
It 's not that I have to plan on <unk> , but it can also begin to <unk> .
And secondly , I can block out all the <unk> by <unk> the <unk> of my breath .
Thanks a lot .
So , as you can see , my film permit is to develop new traits that <unk> the way our <unk> and <unk> are working .
and today , I had time to show them a part of this new <unk> and some of the crew we work on in our contract .
{ \ pos ( 192,220 ) } The <unk> I 'd like to give them on the line , { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } that we { \ pos ( 192,210 ) } <unk> to the New Mexico desert world { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } with our <unk> militia .
Thank you very much .
I look forward to them all !
Yeah , good day .
I 'm glad I 'm here .
So what 's <unk> ?
I have to try and get a little hard on myself and get really involved in modern <unk> .
I 've been studying <unk> , and I 've been practicing for a couple of years now with the <unk> , and I 've started because I wanted to know more and more closely what I learned myself in theory .
Okay , that was my primary emitter relay .
So it was a <unk> , and I kind of wanted to get closer to the crime scene , so .
I think the <unk> in general right now , so all talked , <unk> , everything that matters , <unk> , and so on ,
What 's extremely important now is extremely important and much more important will become more important in <unk> .
There are still steam pipes like these <unk> switch across the <unk> .
Now there are <unk> <unk> in the <unk> who 's trying to convert <unk> , so <unk> <unk> .
There are also some 40 muscular young girls who have just come into the city of <unk> , which is most unaware , is not known , to let us wash them out , who are full of <unk> .
and the <unk> can continue on .
So from the angle of access to this technology , I just moved on into it .
Why are you hacking into this ?
Most people know that from the underground base .
<unk> , and then it 's always gonna be in the police academy , yeah , break the school board somewhere and then go on .
It 's kind of sad for the <unk> , because it doesn 't really fit into what it started , and what it really is .
And they started the <unk> process , which allowed us to enter the <unk> process , and in turn it into the <unk> .
And it 's about releasing a creative , creative , original kind , kind of problem to solve .
And it 's just been shut down with <unk> but there 's also a <unk> machine , there 's a whole bunch of surveillance planning <unk> with all possible <unk> .
But it 's also a news program , and you can program it , and you can hack it , and I think it 's fascinating , and I just wanted to get in on it with a lot deeper in it .
That actually only took 2,000 or two thousand <unk> to get these in .
There are <unk> 's world <unk> , which is originally from the <unk> , it 's a chemical factory with a large <unk> crew in <unk> , but it 's now a world where people have started .
But it 's always about finding a loose person like that to have a sex blink of an eye .
And then there are <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
This is from the <unk> of a <unk> , it 's actually more of a kind of social convention where you meet online and debate .
They 're a bit of technological <unk> and a little bit of <unk> on the road , and then there 's gonna be some sort of <unk> , yes .
And given these <unk> who have made the popular story ... Has become one of those <unk> I would like to brief a few moments .
Now , if you 're gonna have a picture on the left , it 's a <unk> painting , so , you know , some kind of middle school , you can go where everyone 's going .
Old guys , all kinds of kids go down there just to get used to building up a war party , and see what you can do when these test subjects .
There 's a <unk> on the left at <unk> , which means they 've been around for quite a long time .
Longer than these other two <unk> .
These are also looking into some kind of <unk> organic <unk> and , yeah , <unk> that combine it on some kind of <unk> art .
And I 'm looking up at a picture of a tissue loss at the Medical Coast Guard on <unk> with a fountain of youth .
And that 's , yeah , that 's usually kind of young people , but the only thing that unites a certain value is technology .
And what you can do with that thing and that 's also aimed at the collection and asking for input , so , okay , what do you know , what you got so bad to do with it ?
So , <unk> , to now score <unk> , you need some chicken foot .
You need biological <unk> , and you need also child support , and that 's a michael .
These are sort of <unk> , which is normally known under a long-term Alex , which are some sort of fucked up , extremely expensive , but <unk> , by the acceptable elsewhere , and so on .
And our business plan was just to say , <unk> , that actually you don 't have to do that .
It 's not really necessary , because every <unk> has actually developed higher priority than most basic technology , that 's actually so .
and with that <unk> of yours with that shape of mind then tried to build a luxury shop in <unk> , using it as a " <unk> " .
So everyone who 's been a sick fuck ever since ... who 's left him for too long , has done it .
I tried it at my place in my <unk> home , bit of <unk> , and then stuck it on to <unk> , and then I bought it a little bit of a Home <unk> , so try to do it again .
and this is <unk> , who just mentioned <unk> , this yes , some kind of <unk> in the blood type for molecular <unk> .
and yeah , well , you see , it 's relatively minor <unk> , so that 's what stops it from <unk> who do it all by themselves , all alone in the <unk> area .
And then that 's what we were all about to share , yes .
and what are our judge and what are our future , our treasury people ?
And then we worked out a love potion .
That was intuitive , so everybody just wishes his own way , and that , whatever moves him , then , put it down .
A perfectly good <unk> .
and we didn 't catch that one then , but that 's a good thing , I guess . People are pretty close .
and we 've even been trying to get it back to academic , but it somehow didn 't get here .
So I think we 're from the world 's Fair planet . In fact , one more step over than the academic question .
Yeah , what kind of price do we do ?
It was a fallacy that I did with the <unk> in the <unk> itself , that we created an so-called optical illusion or heart .
You see that down there .
And then we <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and we pulled out the <unk> , and then we tried to push on this dance thing .
and that didn 't work out , but we still got a lot of learning .
It went pretty cool .
He 's got one of those , you know , kind of a <unk> sort of thing , you know , he 's been dealing with , you know , kind of a <unk> kind , kind of thing .
And then he built this pile of garbage cans over there , and in the middle of nowhere , this went on .
That 's when the <unk> could go in the control room , sit on that chair , put on this <unk> .
Then their approach was <unk> , and after what they thought , or how they felt , it was different in the control room .
He was a pretty fancy <unk> .
<unk> the other <unk> that has to do with that <unk> there , is the madness that is the <unk> , which is the complicated <unk> .
So it 's about making <unk> gear , to multiply , <unk> , to see how you can make it visible .
and the <unk> that do such a thing , which are quite expensive , you buy from <unk> , they go as <unk> .
and that 's not in the least amount of evidence , but it 's a really cool priority technology that can really do .
So that 's just a huge leap of faith you can make with it .
I think , like , a silver dollar or something .
But , anyway , it 's still not cheap , but it 's always in a school where it 's gonna go right .
So it 's my favorite restaurant after a very pale <unk> .
One night , the other day I started was building a company car .
<unk> is , yes , like some kind of <unk> <unk> who shoot about two <unk> or so .
You invite <unk> on <unk> and the <unk> to this <unk> , and then I shot them in <unk> , and then they set it up like this .
So that 's what happens when you see it doesn 't work .
But that 's my <unk> thing , which looked pretty awesome , but it looked so <unk> on a dime , the thing with the lens , and it went up too high , and it went to the end .
and then I took a <unk> and hooked up to it .
Imagine if you 're full of <unk> , the guy has enough cash , so I think it 's a good thing to do .
And with that , the <unk> can move up faster and then they can also go into the <unk> .
And that commercial is about to cost , like , <unk> up or something , just about 50 bucks .
So it 's not the same <unk> , but it 's doable .
So , and that 's just for now , that 's the most advanced point of the human production that has proven to increase the location of technology and the distribution network that people are developing more .
Because , like when you proposed to me , it 's an extremely important asset , and most people have very low <unk> of it , and no defense to form , really well .
Because if you only read about it from book learning , it 's not the same as when you 've seen it yourself or once .
And I think priority technology will always be more important in our modern <unk> .
And if you want to make an offer as an organised <unk> that can happen to meet a collection of <unk> and you want to know that it 's essential for technology and means Special .
and you have to do it , and understand it to make it and understand it .
And then the <unk> then <unk> beneath the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
So you 're being transferred to the <unk> just by <unk> scientific method .
and this is the tenderloin of hash !
These are the people who signed up for at least signed up for their <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's quite a number of <unk> infections worldwide .
And also interesting is that they also represent in <unk> .
I think they 're there less people than really exist .
So I know about some who hasn 't signed up .
and these are just the <unk> , individual people .
Along with these twin attacks , so that 's where they trace it .
And that 's the end of it at first .
As I was saying , <unk> just started it .
and <unk> , so the short version , since the prison attack at <unk> was the first , <unk> .
and it has become a world of great <unk> , yes , <unk> who have been represented everywhere .
And of course , we hope that we stay the same way , and then we 're as good as <unk> , so that people can be involved in this .
And I would ask everyone to take a chance and try one myself .
It 's not that simple now , but it 's not impossible to get around to it , and it 's hard enough to get there , and you can get far .
Thank you for listening .
That 's it .
Yes , hello .
How do we even work ?
That 's one question that moves me very much as a <unk> but also at the pro shop in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's about how you hit people in <unk> so they can use this <unk> <unk> , and make them <unk> whenever they can .
Because I believe that the <unk> <unk> within us <unk> , cognitive thinking , so wars actually created in our organ was very , very , very , very , very , very , very long time , and we just realized that the DNA results have just <unk> .
And that 's very amazing , because you actually think that the <unk> that you 've run into is actually the one thing that really brings you in , but , in fact , it 's totally <unk> with us .
What 's <unk> <unk> now ?
I 've written down four times and I 'd like to make this brief .
By stealing the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> we have in the <unk> <unk> .
This is a natural state that we have a natural defense system for the next system .
That sounds unusual .
But I 'm going to go back and try to prove to them that they have a natural <unk> .
The second baseman has had our guy speaking for as long as we 've been using this <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the most <unk> , much , in the past .
And the third baseman has explained himself .
Now , we all know that the <unk> are <unk> by corporate fat cats , which contains the most basic <unk> of the blood flow , and , of course , say , that we feel natural <unk> today .
The fourth thing is , the alarm codes for us are a place of crisis .
How is this now with the world 's most <unk> , the most organized nuclear power <unk> ?
Let me show you .
How many <unk> does that have in which you live ?
We won 't be able to answer that right now , but this is what 's gonna happen and happens right now .
They walk in the comic book business across the street , they live in <unk> , looking at how many there are .
And that 's what they do .
They supported the occupation forces and well without any <unk> .
Fantastic , right ?
and since we are giving ourselves jobs for example , to pay homage to the virtual <unk> in our <unk> , we can do this all the time .
And this combined intellect could achieve the most <unk> , which had forbidden food in the <unk> , because they had nothing to do with it .
They didn 't have <unk> .
Or they didn 't have a death scene .
They didn 't have any grape .
The only thing they had was their head .
and in this head the <unk> were playing .
In this map 's mind , it was informed and through this virtual belief that <unk> , was informed as well .
And that is why it is so strong in us that we can take advantage of the <unk> .
The interesting part , if I get to make a little retirement .
Yes , I can .
The interesting part is that at this time the <unk> was both <unk> and <unk> .
If they think of a <unk> next time .
What are <unk> today ?
Then they 'll realize there 's been a war simulation .
But I 'll be right back .
<unk> of the fertility drugs have been everywhere for years .
Now , <unk> , so-called peers , were especially so left to keep <unk> .
And even today we are still hanging very , very strong on <unk> .
According to the joint increased taxes of the pond , <unk> <unk> <unk> , we still spend every year on balance with the <unk> of <unk> .
That means to a child who has spent most of the time in his <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
Now we think our dear friend has a tendency to doubt that we 've been sitting in the middle of our <unk> family .
No , no , far away .
This goes way back to the gay community .
For me , however , in the advanced infrared industry , more impressive than most , it is we have come down with a <unk> transplant from the <unk> .
I brought you a glimpse of the highest bidder of the <unk> .
and they lived in the <unk> of <unk> .
and as you can see , that 's a very <unk> bike ride , and you had to navigate there somehow come from island to land <unk> .
And they did that with called <unk> .
They might know that if they 're interested in the Australian standard of <unk> .
They have similar <unk> .
They don 't have <unk> , they used <unk> <unk> , or <unk> .
And what 's interesting is that the <unk> and the <unk> could be <unk> over heels .
Who fought the <unk> forces of <unk> <unk> .
That means you charge over heels and over <unk> .
AND THESE <unk> AND THESE <unk> <unk> <unk> HAVE THE <unk> <unk> OF A <unk> <unk> AND , OF course , THAT THE <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> HAVE <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> TO <unk> ,
Why don 't we sing , uh ,
Not to navigate .
What happened ?
This is what happened to <unk> .
We 've moved in the called <unk> before .
The thing happened at the crime scene and happened to the lab , and it happened .
And that 's exactly what happened , we 're <unk> the <unk> to our <unk> collection and those of our individual <unk> on external <unk> .
Now this is the picture .
I 'm afraid we 've lost our grasp of <unk> .
<unk> suddenly became a stranger to us , and has nothing to do with the <unk> .
From the fruit shop to the Alps .
What did <unk> think of our <unk> and on our <unk> ?
And then the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And they will be run over by the <unk> in the field , more by the <unk> of the sea .
Which means , instead of remembering , we have <unk> , <unk> , everywhere else in <unk> , <unk> <unk> by <unk> , where we can hang our personal <unk> .
We no longer produce ourselves .
We have a security bypass module one <unk> .
We don 't fool the <unk> of things that don 't work in the world anymore . We humiliate you .
We got used to things getting hurt .
And we 've accepted the standard shift as a crop battle , and there are only <unk> , like the <unk> .
What 's left is behind .
Still , we 're still under the influence of the National Soccer Tournament , very strong .
What 's next ?
We had the final lap of life , and we were on the road , and now we 're running what 's called <unk> .
That sounds very <unk> and sounds like <unk> , I know .
But this lottery of title , which brings us these <unk> back to track our <unk> .
It 's about <unk> , it 's about <unk> , it 's about <unk> .
Let me explain this for a while .
Now , there are technical <unk> like draft rates , which means the standard <unk> .
Of course , as crazy as it sounds in the tunnel of my mind ... we 're not moving in physically , virtual <unk> ... after the touch of the script .
and other people , they 're the <unk> , intelligent services .
That 's what makes the intelligent people possible .
All this takes the approach , our group <unk> , as to accept the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I have in the <unk> and I hope the <unk> works , a very , very beautiful <unk> , this is Michael <unk> , and <unk> 's <unk> and <unk> .
And those two interns are here today .
Maybe you can get up for a second so they can talk to each other about the <unk> .
and that <unk> I brought with me as an ass leader , as is addressed to this <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I have to say this .
Which , of course , is extremely <unk> and it 's a <unk> .
And when I say breast implants ... then they 'll probably have a very strong hand in person ... that there are certain <unk> in front of people ... or that they 're playing with some kind of <unk> .
In any case they do .
It 's a play for outside .
and this is the most wanted world for me to discover the real world , so I 'm seeing it again .
and this play sets the virtual world , so the dating industry we collect is bringing in the real world .
I apologize for being so hard on you .
You can explain that much better , because there 's a lot more to it .
It 's about me being able to identify a satellite computer by tracking what positive or <unk> positive .
and so I am granted one person from the order to another , an entirely positive search engine , a complete false one , and so <unk> on this <unk> , and so familiar with a basic infrared eye .
And we can look at that now .
Uh , what you can see here , sorry , is another little matter of what you see right now .
Of course , this virtual world lives in the world of our <unk> , is clear .
and with some kind of check , we can make this virtual <unk> .
Thanks a lot .
I 'm very happy to be with you .
I was just asked if that phone call was there , and mine is gonna be talking .
He won 't do that .
I 'll also destroy what 's in there .
I don 't know , but I 'm kind of curious .
Yes , children of <unk> are curious or maybe curious to be , too .
I am <unk> from the dinner table , so , of course , I am confused with the further down of the market share of the world and changing the crowd as it may have to be .
This is a whole <unk> operation of footage you 're dealing with next to the actual elephant next to the class .
They become curious and they become <unk> often .
And that 's what I had in the last half of <unk> .
a <unk> to North Korean <unk> <unk> .
Now , they 're gonna wonder why the <unk> are starting to <unk> with such natural , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> and so on .
And all I 'm thinking is one of those highly sensitive little things , because things should always be more natural , more natural , and there you have to see , which is , of course , for us , or whatever .
So I 'm struggling with it , like , if there 's , uh , any question .
You might need to see it again .
Why does that even happen ?
So if we take a look at the <unk> of our nation right here , then we 're gonna move from the 3rd or the <unk> .
So from the modern <unk> .
Each load is made by a <unk> .
The mission was at the start of the <unk> race .
<unk> , it is said to have been found that you spoke a common <unk> , you could communicate , you know , connected to the same <unk> , or , in a <unk> , series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
But the thing about social security was that thing , you know , a natural thing , a very living thing .
Although you had to learn , no <unk> can speak of <unk> , but we learn to keep it short and natural .
That was relieved by the ancient tribe and the first <unk> of the <unk> .
That was a <unk> back then , because , of course , the live <unk> began to spin live in the <unk> of <unk> , which means what is , <unk> is alive and I started it , with that .
depending on the way I am and when I 'm fishing , it 's a completely different <unk> than there 's one of them alive .
But then <unk> moved up these <unk> as a mistake proposal .
And then came the next <unk> we actually live in today .
This is just the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and others .
Then it was as an action figure , where <unk> , <unk> and other people actually say , if people are beginning to read , then the people are totally annoying .
<unk> us completely , of course , because we 're looking at a pressure gauge the new <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and so on .
and those two <unk> are banging on each other right now , new thinking .
This is the closest thing to you , seeing this new company , getting to a very exciting company , <unk> of many , <unk> and <unk> from the <unk> .
Not anymore , this village <unk> , this is <unk> <unk> .
We understand that this is <unk> <unk> .
that <unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
Not if I think <unk> here and the <unk> thinks less , and it doesn 't work anymore .
That is , in the local assume , a Japanese border policy has become a <unk> of equal , so , if possible , persistent income , but also the total <unk> .
Just as they used to know in the debris field , who had what happened to who and when , today , it happens to be the <unk> of our mobile phone bills .
Never say we know <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
Just like it happened on the <unk> Labor Day weekend .
Before the <unk> , I was just kind of busy looking at what it 's called , which is for us , of course , what do we have ?
Because a lot of people come here , they can 't do it <unk> so that everybody can handle it .
So you have to deal with what it means , and not just change that it 's different , but it should be better .
You get busy , even on the basketball court , with the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> .
And that 's certainly something you start and you tell me , okay , I 'll just look into the inside yourself .
What about in there ?
So what do we do when we get inside ?
And what does , of course , intuitive and how do our cognitive thinking of <unk> and how does that work ?
Because <unk> once said you need to get to <unk> where it 's going .
So you really have to check in on <unk> , if I want to make some <unk> or subconscious <unk> , which means the management style .
and watching how do we process See how we develop <unk> ?
What 's <unk> ?
- What difference does it make ?
Many people use the <unk> , but they don 't know what it means , then .
But I have to understand , in the Tim 's kicking stuff , when being <unk> , if possible out of these things are going to follow me in the direction of going after that , I know how to resolve or later ,
And of course , however , <unk> is taking <unk> to the <unk> .
So much more natural for a DNA sample , but I 'm seeing right where <unk> and <unk> is in it .
And when I tell somebody , give me a jump on it or something , then he 's gonna think about where it is .
and the left intuitive and I hope that there 's no <unk> in there that 's actually proper <unk> in there .
But our <unk> machine makes them betray us .
Look at those <unk> in the <unk> .
the right hand is bigger than the little one , though it 's not even the case , it 's just they 're as big as they are , and yet still changing our jobs in what direction we 've become .
Does anyone know what this is ?
Come on .
<unk> <unk> was supposed to be working .
It 's gonna be a little late for my <unk> .
So it 's a <unk> .
A second <unk> is starting to shudder to <unk> .
It 's called <unk> or <unk> that actually affects us in the <unk> process .
Most importantly for the <unk> , they have it in the first days , the great <unk> .
The closer to the crop circles and so forth .
You forget about it a lot .
But that 's a very important <unk> approach if you want to start and confuse the issue .
The next candidate 's whatever it is interesting is the most interesting idea .
I know it sounds awesome , but it 's exciting when you 're closer to it .
So we got the front doors , and now they think we 're gonna move on from behind .
This is wrong .
You 'll see from behind .
Because she wears a <unk> tray in front that they see something they see , <unk> <unk> .
That means we won 't see our <unk> until we see it bring it back to our <unk> , okay ?
I 've got some <unk> , you 've got some <unk> , Anything you want to see .
That 's when it comes back .
Then it 's going to the front because the back doesn 't trust you , and now you really want to check it out , make sure that 's what you see .
And then it goes back to the back , and then it 's actually seen .
So , you know , it 's a really , really exciting mess . Like finding out what happens to these things .
I don 't know who these pictures are .
That 's exactly what I said .
Now everyone 's trying to see something from this <unk> .
I don 't know who sees it .
Anybody see anything in particular ?
<unk> , exactly .
Once I 've seen that it 's a <unk> thing in there , they know that .
They 'll never forget because I 'm showing them where the <unk> is .
Now they see the <unk> .
And now they always see him .
Now , that means I 've actually spoiled her , that she no longer seems to have these <unk> , but I 've wasted my time on her , in this ridiculous cooler .
and this is that wall of grass , <unk> , see .
Now I know , and now I 'm beginning to see the <unk> .
I see the <unk> .
All right , all this exciting <unk> stuff ... it 's not gray , but right here on this <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Does anyone know what three <unk> are ?
Yes .
This is our <unk> .
So , it 's always interesting to know as a <unk> either .
I know it 's going to take three <unk> off the list , so to speak to one of the <unk> screws , then I can spend most of my time crossing with them .
He needs to process this as a <unk> .
Well , then it takes a drive on the main roads , and so I can really do an <unk> watching <unk> on the enemies ' side if I know this one .
What 's taking <unk> ?
Yes , <unk> .
A whole wide variety of culinary delights .
It 's the most <unk> in love with .
Which means , <unk> , if you know this now , watch who you watch for , because I don 't do a <unk> , which can happen right now .
She 's 16 <unk> , a whole <unk> 16 .
This is the most <unk> crew we have .
That means this first feed happens in a Hurry jump point , like we shoot birds .
And as we see it , at what we 're watching , and how we can also protect ourselves against our <unk> , so we can work it right .
Of course , the <unk> not only occupy itself with the <unk> of the militia and <unk> <unk> , but with the backing of the <unk> .
So how does a <unk> meet with certain <unk> <unk> and fitting correct ?
There 's this kind of a studio tour group , so this kind of thing called <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> I know exactly where to attack .
But then again , why does someone have to rise up to some minor amount of energy , even though it 's not so <unk> ?
Here we are , more likely on the economic system with the <unk> we sit in on as <unk> of course .
Back to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> And the , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> always means how can I reach a number of targets fast or how can a <unk> <unk> be effective in a specific or possible effective course of action .
That 's what the <unk> say .
How can I do something freely ?
I can operate right now , or I need a <unk> , or I need a proper <unk> on it .
and less <unk> , or <unk> .
I don 't think I 'm making this any more specific and more beautiful doesn 't mean it 's more profound .
You have to understand that .
<unk> <unk> is not only a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , when I 'm about to start thinking about currently <unk> <unk> .
Why ?
Because in him we 're running through this new kind of <unk> , so the natural causes , like , five times faster in the forward target ?
They need to imagine that , if they do something to the classic <unk> , five <unk> , and with this new , natural , <unk> art form .
That doesn 't mean they can probably go home for four <unk> , but their <unk> , or anyone 's ever noticed him running around with the 4 <unk> on it .
I 'm trying to tell you , of course , it 's a good old-fashioned way to meet .
When we hit the <unk> line again , here to perform the first <unk> line that was real abstract where you needed to work with that <unk> .
Then came the next one who 's been dealing with a mental health <unk> or mental health <unk> like the <unk> , worked , which would 've been creating a <unk> theory of some <unk> theory , <unk> theory .
So no more <unk> and <unk> or <unk> <unk> ... but a <unk> .
That 's what made it a lot of <unk> , but of course it 's much better .
The next resident of <unk> <unk> has been working a lot more .
So there I am , a lot more common than acting .
It 's a <unk> .
I just want to say that it always looks more and more pathetic to the competition .
And then when I touch a step back into those <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I agree with , <unk> , by <unk> , and not <unk> , and then I have to control speed .
Well , that brings me back to my place at night , when do things get going ?
If they become <unk> , and then I have to go back and see my little <unk> here and see what does that mean , from the <unk> , when is there really something real ?
And that 's a lot of <unk> to us if I have to rethink that .
So apparently , he doesn 't want to think . He just wants to play it .
The less I think about it , the less it is .
And what does that mean for the <unk> ?
That means when we see that we can replace <unk> <unk> from one to another , the giant who can 't control the <unk> , then I can do this as a <unk> .
Which means I can just transfer human rights to a <unk> deal , make it a way for the <unk> .
Of course , the people wonder , what is the most advanced human being of us and now I have already betrayed it .
That 's what 's called digging .
It 's what every one of us and <unk> is a <unk> and it stands for direction , <unk> , <unk> .
That 's what each one of them 's doing all the time , but he 's doing it slow and subconscious , or even subconscious .
The <unk> is already in the media room , so it works <unk> young and old , and is used by us all along the way , without so most of that knowledge , most of which is <unk> .
Fifty thousand gallons , fifty each , depending on each one of us , so we fall asleep in the sleep that it will go less than the next day .
I can now possess this mental power , <unk> , <unk> , relate to a <unk> .
and through this kind of <unk> , like the <unk> , but no more a physical <unk> , but a physical <unk> .
and that is on a higher influence of the <unk> ... than the <unk> of a classic <unk> , the kiss theory .
I can transfer the whole thing .
I 'll try to get by on a hair from a <unk> .
Everybody 's had chicken soup .
In a way , I sort of play with the <unk> , can <unk> again , <unk> .
I can lick the entire subspace grid right now , and I can tell you , just show me all the home improvements with <unk> , for example .
and have a <unk> , which is more natural and more natural .
I 'd like to help you find a specific area of <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> won 't learn .
That 's why they 're all here and are just curious about the people who did a punch line you can 't learn .
I 'm dealing with it now , practically this whole <unk> thing , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> in <unk> .
and there 's a central point here .
and he 's into recycling .
Give <unk> a kick .
Every day they give up , they give off about two sets of cell towers and every day , they have to pick up two <unk> .
They can 't have <unk> .
No one can retain their spirit .
They can 't have <unk> .
We could only glide as a <unk> through the <unk> .
When we didn 't do a <unk> and split .
It 's like we 're working on something here , which is , like , a joke ad for us , but it 's not like that .
Because everyone 's talking about <unk> , but nobody 's talking about <unk> .
<unk> is much critical .
We 're down from two <unk> .
We 've only got a couple of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and now there 's a lot more <unk> produced in the world than any <unk> in the world .
alone in the last 20 <unk> have been distributed <unk> <unk> ... on our <unk> guest list in <unk> .
And we 'll take it all .
It makes <unk> with <unk> .
And we think we 'd be protecting the <unk> if we 're a little less harmful .
So , for example , for example , <unk> the <unk> , less <unk> .
Try the control systems , make less noise .
less <unk> .
That 's not a <unk> .
That 's like saying <unk> your kid , just beat it three times instead of minutes .
It 's just a little less <unk> .
When we feel so much about the height of them as the stick , our whole line of work will be a little quicker or later .
Which is why she 's a little <unk> .
And the most important thing about looking at us in the first one .
<unk> , 60 ! <unk> !
Right now we 're building <unk> between 11 and 30 <unk> per square miles , or even halfway to the <unk> .
We lose more ground in the <unk> system than <unk> .
Of course , we can look at the <unk> first .
And everything 's piping or <unk> .
Three for one , 20 among them is already dead .
And because we get older , the <unk> get bigger .
That 's them , so to speak .
Yeah ?
a baby needs about growing flowers .
We could reduce that to ten profit , but what does that do ?
It 's gonna be in <unk> at a level .
It 's completely trivial .
So the question is , how do we deal with the <unk> ?
By the way , if you can prove to me that <unk> are not <unk> .
I want to tell them .
Because <unk> is handed in <unk> near the firm of <unk> <unk> .
I don 't know .
Yeah .
So <unk> can 't be a <unk> .
It 's occupied , right ?
By conventional thinking , we 're <unk> , we 're too many on the world .
And if you were the people who were once the <unk> to exist when they say that would be better , you wouldn 't even be there , then you 'd be soaked and freezing .
And someone as <unk> <unk> , one of our major <unk> , there is nothing more important than securing human <unk> .
They say that when you save a <unk> you save the <unk> .
This says the more you kill , the better .
Yeah .
The first question is , are we really too many ?
When you look at the <unk> , the <unk> 's <unk> on the pet list , then the <unk> drops like the human race .
I could also get <unk> , but nobody likes hotel rooms as far as they 're <unk> .
That means the core <unk> much more than we do .
and because she 's been working a lot harder than us , and because they only live three to six <unk> , they fit in their <unk> , a little <unk> .
Which means we 're not too many , we 're too stupid , right ?
They can only be <unk> if they don 't exist .
The only survivor .
Have you ever seen a <unk> <unk> ?
Yeah ?
One ?
Which means that our entire space program means that we want to be dumber than <unk> , yes ?
Yeah ?
No <unk> is <unk> .
Fortunately not , yes ?
There 's no <unk> on <unk> .
There 's still <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You 've heard of <unk> <unk> ?
That means that all of our subjects are meant to be stupider than candle arms .
and where they see themselves with something like <unk> , the <unk> allowing <unk> to go back , not that our own <unk> would go back .
Every mil we lose , we lose three million <unk> <unk> that really should go back to <unk> .
and we 're too many .
All alone .
That means we feel so guilty on the brass ring that we say there 's no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no way they all go back , that our own chicken soup .
Isn 't that sad ?
We 're too many .
I 'm sure it 's useful to be less harmful than waiting .
But where are we useful ?
We 're trying to minimize our book code , but it 's about having a big hedge fund that 's useful .
We want to be good for the collection , we want to be good for the <unk> , but when it comes to the highest bidder , is that not to be there ?
<unk> , huh ?
They can only have <unk> when they 're not there .
Even if they were gonna shoot themselves now , they 'd have <unk> .
So they can 't solve this .
We can do it differently .
We can recover our <unk> .
We do <unk> <unk> in the <unk> where we win the <unk> back .
In fact , we can go directly to this type of guy and wise <unk> in <unk> .
We do that in <unk> , for example , where we take the <unk> from .
In <unk> , there 's a poetry lesson in the book , so to speak .
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to return our reinforcements .
It means that the entire western section has taken everything that the alien has never returned anything .
It 's how the <unk> grew longer because the <unk> went into the <unk> and the <unk> had to continue to take their <unk> .
That 's why all the <unk> are always <unk> until they 've failed the <unk> and then they 're <unk> .
Yeah ?
It was different in <unk> .
One has managed to get over <unk> <unk> because you 've always been in the obvious business of bringing the <unk> back .
Even today , when they 're invited to dinner in <unk> , you expect to eat as long as they stay until they arrive .
It 's not nice to walk and take the ride with you .
They treat her to eat , not to jump .
That means they can see how to win back the <unk> .
And the great thing is , the oil prices in the <unk> were going back to <unk> testing .
So we don 't have to control the people , not to be a handful .
We can support them to be good .
It 's naturally dull , but the <unk> are wearing themselves .
<unk> is clean <unk> .
And they are set up by the <unk> that a donor can just send it back .
That means go back the <unk> .
And no <unk> of these <unk> we have now built over <unk> in the last twenty <unk> , none of these <unk> have ever been created .
They could easily break a <unk> 's coin toss and then the <unk> would be ruined by <unk> .
It won 't happen .
That means we don 't have to control the <unk> if we can 't be sick .
We can support them to be good .
That means we have to <unk> .
And by the way , if you want to do something , you write down , make yourself the best suited for all the <unk> .
Unfortunately , they can 't go to <unk> , but they might be able to help with their <unk> .
For the <unk> <unk> could most well win the <unk> back .
and he has to go back .
Let 's make sure <unk> is very critical .
And we can see that it 's done .
We 've now been using over three <unk> .
The <unk> has explained that they will be the first country along the planet , which is <unk> <unk> .
But we need that total .
They understand there are two <unk> controlling <unk> of the world 's largest <unk> technology .
There 's the <unk> of a <unk> .
Those are <unk> controlled by <unk> of the radiation sickness .
and the <unk> will be replaced by other means of defense .
But you cannot replace the <unk> .
That 's not about making <unk> a little less bad , but it 's about making something right .
and , in particular , is to ask what 's right .
That means it 's about <unk> , not <unk> .
In <unk> , surely it is easier to understand the land is built on the land .
Yeah ?
Imagine if , for example , her wife is sad when she <unk> her , and they come up with fifty <unk> .
<unk> .
but very effective , yes ?
Or take a <unk> .
a woman in petticoats eat about six hours of their school hours .
With this .
Not exactly true because we don 't know how much <unk> is becoming .
but an action figure , even on this one , I can tell them , is an extremely efficient , but effective and effective , yes ?
Everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
It 's not just <unk> , it 's <unk> .
To ask , what 's the right thing ?
Not to burn the <unk> a little bit better with it and then wrap it up in <unk> to lose all the <unk> for <unk> , but to ask how to lock it first ?
Be efficient to be <unk> .
Yeah ?
May I show her a drink ? Yes , sir .
Wonderful ?
This is efficient .
All that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
What if they fall in love with someone , efficient ?
Yeah ?
That means that all that matters in life is not to save it , to reduce .
all the <unk> .
Let 's say the finger " Oh , yeah , you don 't have a bathing suit in the sand .
No , that 's exactly the right thing to throw away , yeah ?
Put you where you can put it , of course you can do it again .
But the wrong things happen .
When you come through the wrong things , you have a power vacuum .
the way we think of <unk> .
It 's every <unk> <unk> .
When they walk , yeah , any member <unk> the <unk> .
Because the wind just kills the <unk> . And the <unk> are washing the <unk> .
But if they 're in <unk> , every <unk> means that the <unk> stays in the <unk> .
So , it 's about getting a big holiday victim .
Don 't look back .
We say <unk> <unk> .
Yeah ?
But if I ask her , how are you doing with your wife ?
What are they saying ?
<unk> .
Then I say he 's a <unk> , yes ?
That 's the frustrating part .
So don 't save anymore .
Every <unk> is <unk> .
And it 's a fashion show when they see people giving in lip gloss over there staring off a ghost !
Because they know it 's a traditional <unk> .
It 's a hologram from <unk> , right ?
They can show I was there .
But with the right handling , please .
We , for example , developed a 50 year old college fund runs a factory on <unk> Street .
They can <unk> where they go and stand .
It 's built in two <unk> .
And it contains rare plants so that they can pour it out through the Christmas gates .
That means we 're useful , not least harmful .
So it 's two <unk> .
I don 't want it all to be fried .
a fire drill or a <unk> they only use that they don 't consume .
I mean , just things , um , sort of like <unk> , like <unk> , you know , they have to be like <unk> .
You know , things that just get used are going into mechanical engineering .
But today we 're just talking about the biological <unk> .
Yeah ?
You know , for the <unk> , right ?
Simple , <unk> , and not yet for the <unk> <unk> , but to do that , they are now <unk> to this success .
'Cause we don 't get things through .
Yeah ?
So , if I ask her to dinner and say that it 's free of <unk> , then that helps them nothing .
No , we 'll hang on to what 's inside .
It 's positive .
So not like <unk> .
Don 't fall in there .
But everything in it is useful .
These are the first cases they can put the time machine on the <unk> , and the <unk> can go to prison , yes ?
All of it is Indian .
And if we do , of course , we do find ourselves <unk> , for <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> and all the <unk> .
and that is half the world 's largest cubic kilometers <unk> .
That 's why you 're helping , ask for the <unk> .
Hey , <unk> , are you really serious ?
Because they 've already changed the charts twice .
And I 'm not so sure they 're really gonna come back .
So , give me a hand with this .
But I can .
Yeah .
what just happened .
I can do that .
We can make these things seem like they 're <unk> when they come back with <unk> , they can <unk> in <unk> .
technical <unk> is just the same .
There 's a book signing for this .
This is the first truly offensive scheme , actually , to go back to the <unk> .
That , too , so in every one of these things , you can mess things up .
When they get there , will they ?
Do they remember the <unk> ?
If it 's the <unk> for now .
There 's a conspiracy everywhere . Almost everything .
In the <unk> where people come from .
Over there on the <unk> but in the <unk> area , right ?
Yeah ?
alone when they take these <unk> , they <unk> , they <unk> , then they snip the <unk> to carve out <unk> .
The baby is full of ground already .
So we don 't have to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
It 's about a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Sort of .
Yeah ?
We can do that .
We can make it all up again .
I found a seal around it .
A lot of people are working there now , and they can all hire themselves .
There 's an extra <unk> about where everyone can participate .
So no more saving , <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , but intelligent services .
Is she curious ?
Thank you .
The work of the painting .
More perceptive than security .
It is written in my speech on the floor of my culture that I prepare as an <unk> , so in the English Military papers , I understand .
It 's because of the written , it 's written in <unk> .
From <unk> to the English might need more knowledge , especially if it 's about <unk> or <unk> .
It 's a stranger , but for <unk> , what we do with our <unk> .
first when I was on a roll , I was passing on the written notice .
They probably think the <unk> drug worked out exactly the <unk> he was poking around .
<unk> are very vague and <unk> .
These <unk> are roughly the same , or <unk> , like a <unk> , if very seemingly accurate , <unk> , a <unk> .
Because in this trim is not the money to smell the flowers , the moment of the sand , it is absolutely not to hear the flow of the <unk> fire , not to feel .
That means the <unk> must translate the <unk> <unk> <unk> in one other , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Today , I want to tell them what I normally listen to , so , <unk> , once more to a music hall .
So practically a security bypass module .
Which is why I 'm planning on doing this all the better in the German , because if I had to translate to the English lady , it would be <unk> for me with the <unk> <unk> .
The ones that work for me are similar to the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> have the <unk> of a <unk> .
So it 's not enough to just learn how to read lips and try to draw the right <unk> on the <unk> or press the proper <unk> .
'Cause that 's just the <unk> you learned to paint .
You can 't tell the difference between a member of the <unk> .
It takes years for a film to deliver on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
There are also whispers and which can be determined only to speak , till musical until the musical picture show can be read .
The work of the <unk> is similar to the work of a corporate research .
First of all , when you choose a piano lesson to play because you 're excited about it , you begin to look into the <unk> of <unk> .
collect <unk> over the <unk> in the <unk> .
You read in the <unk> , burn , burn , wonder , or if there are any <unk> <unk> from the <unk> itself .
You study the runs he <unk> then <unk> .
You switch on .
to write it .
How and how did he feel ?
How was his blackout , like the company and the policy ?
I 'm interested in all this .
It 's like you think inside that time , watching images flash pictures , even <unk> .
with time , though you also have a rich , white as a rich , <unk> that you play , and it just gets easier to feel in and warm .
The host will always be more to be with .
To write the newspaper story will always be more and more to my personal <unk> to play it .
Now that the <unk> is anything but a direct descendant of the <unk> line , but only a <unk> , I now proceed to this <unk> and to <unk> .
I 'll say with my own <unk> , what could be written between that <unk> .
I play <unk> , which could mean <unk> .
For me and for the equally <unk> that they could mean for him today .
Each <unk> , each cell phone company is given to an <unk> because I feel it , because it 's starting to turn out from my personal system .
It has to be here for me and now being <unk> , or I can 't convince my <unk> of it that 's my wedding present .
It 's always a very happy loading , if I may have the <unk> , the <unk> that I worked out for so long in front of the Buy More .
As you can see a new day over and over and over again , even though I always get up with the same <unk> of the office equipment , going to work at the same time , I always understand the same new things .
I 've grown up another day , changing the roof , my stomach rate is going slower than tomorrow , in a <unk> it takes longer to get home than ever again .
I take the breath of the <unk> , pretty aware or <unk> .
This is affecting me , and all this also affects my <unk> with the <unk> .
Even if I stand on the roof with a <unk> stand , and we have the same blood flow .
Then the same happens in a good , <unk> <unk> .
You bring a new wine chamber , and at once this will be answered with a news flash .
It 's exciting , ' cause then things happen that we don 't practice and what you can 't practice .
It 's fun to make these wise <unk> , and they 've experienced the <unk> , the way fishing <unk> survived alive .
That 's the way every <unk> is a different <unk> .
I 'm never gonna play the same as this moment .
I can 't play like 20 <unk> today .
I shall have more privacy there than today , and so on my daily reconnaissance rides a lot more <unk> than <unk> today .
Sure , I 'll also have kicked out a couple of blocks , but they 've got a whole new flare .
A nice looking party for it .
It was on a losing meadow for the <unk> of my beloved <unk> , a well-known <unk> , a well-known <unk> , <unk> leader , and <unk> of the Nobel Prize in <unk> .
Unfortunately , I was way too young to start studying .
But I had the great fortune to meet him very early , 13 times , and so I was already on my <unk> .
I was 17 when I was in one of his high school plays and I played the last of the four members of a football team .
He asked me what that <unk> was for me .
This is such a private event .
And in my settlement , I said , <unk> .
Is that what he says ?
This must be the auto club .
For me , it means <unk> .
He 's been sixty years old .
Well , you still have 17 dreaming , but not important events .
I play the game games today and all the time , it changed for me , even though there 's no one left to change .
Every time it 's exciting , I keep reading something new .
You know , a figure out a whole other killer who made the most handsome crime scene .
It 's always the same swim team , but it 's <unk> , still different <unk> .
He translated the <unk> back to his acting , just like he saw her the way she did at that moment .
His personal <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> is similar to this one .
I was also older than <unk> with <unk> <unk> when he wrote the letter .
He only lived <unk> once .
And it 's important to me to keep looking into the mountain lions , even if I can mean them by heart .
To keep <unk> , straight with the <unk> .
Because the <unk> are the only <unk> right to him .
Especially when he died .
Now , how do you start talking about the Vice President of the United States ?
I told you , you need about as long as it takes for the <unk> .
It 's often the most <unk> you 've ever seen in class .
It 's typical how you learn to read it first before you can only say one thing .
You learn to find the <unk> on the <unk> .
When every one of them comes in time and right the way it 's in the clear they move , they come out together like this .
If that happens , the <unk> will have a memory loss .
rarely talk about Margery ...
All right , all right , you know , this 'll be a quick <unk> .
<unk> , slow down .
" and <unk> " , dug , " et cetera .
Most people know this .
But even if you are <unk> , it 's still just a matter of mechanical engineering .
And still , it 's not lymphoma .
I 'm surprised .
I 'm surprised to hear that a few things are forgotten .
Because that to make <unk> on the prison walls , doing your own deed , that should be present before .
Because that 's singing .
a child who hasn 't learned to sing it because parents didn 't fake it , neither will I.
It 's like the DMV over there .
It 's necessary to have his own <unk> and <unk> of the gate to make it sound more of an <unk> , so as to make it sound more interesting .
Human beings who have never sung <unk> have never felt understood directly with their own <unk> , as it is to form a <unk> .
<unk> with his own <unk> .
Because this is the <unk> of our relationship .
To sing our song , sing our song , and dance our lullaby .
So the fashion show is the <unk> of my <unk> .
The <unk> grows from the <unk> and the <unk> dance floor .
<unk> treatments available today with <unk> is not <unk> .
You don 't have to make <unk> anymore if it gets boring .
No need to whistle anymore or sing a song .
Every single climb up the street is kicked to be kicked out with <unk> <unk> .
Sure , there are some among them who say yes , but what if I can 't sing ?
They can 't sing , can they ? Because they think they can 't sing ?
Or because they didn 't learn to sing ?
Both are not starting too late to figure out if they can 't learn , or learn how to use those little witchy <unk> , right ?
Because you can train .
or turn back because you 've already told them they 're inseparable .
I wonder how <unk> was competent ?
Did they get a <unk> test tube or do you know how to say it these days ?
Or D , they just don 't like <unk> and want nothing to do with it .
Which I would regret , since <unk> is a beautiful , <unk> <unk> .
But maybe she 's useful too .
Well , you see , all of you have to be a nude <unk> .
But please don 't tell me I don 't know anything about the classic suicide mission .
I can 't tell if it 's good or bad .
I answer that , but surely you can say if they like it or not .
Because I don 't think anyone says I don 't know if I like it because I can 't cook .
They 're not going to eat unless they can cook .
So they don 't have to <unk> even because they don 't have to play a <unk> .
Listen to them , and tell them if they like it or not .
Whether the <unk> flow is too <unk> or too sweet .
They say what they feel .
By the time they get <unk> , they want a little more hot chocolate pudding ... or even taste nice <unk> .
Why am I challenge my <unk> to listen ?
Because the <unk> is a depressed temporal lobe and there 's a <unk> for communicating .
A <unk> you never look at has any <unk> .
eating that out of a Federation or cooking meal requires food and not only be looked at or <unk> .
So please listen when a toss is played .
She 's not just a nice <unk> .
When in a kids ' town , where the <unk> are active or at least likely to listen , a kid grows up , it 's easy for a <unk> , Ask your approach ?
Now can you play them in blue ?
and the child is playing for a stroke , instead of a red <unk> gloves .
And that sounds different from before .
that was then the very first beginning of a musical <unk> .
So the first step to a fresh start .
And what happens when you play a <unk> Today , the first hundred to get read 200 or 200 <unk> ago ?
By now , the <unk> have <unk> .
There was a punishment system at the time when <unk> was out of control .
It just hasn 't been invented yet .
I think the <unk> would have been thrilled if he had the <unk> of modern <unk> group .
I can today the <unk> with the social services that has made the popular appeal of the modern world sound at what a football player cannot do .
Even <unk> knows he heard more than he 'd been numb .
Today is a modern art event in suspended profession , playing everything a bid <unk> of old age has refused .
That is why the <unk> rely on us <unk> who can <unk> the <unk> .
So they can be an <unk> , which only they have in the most inner city limits .
And also what they 'd be thinking about in the market today .
Or what I 'm imagining today because what they might have thought .
Thank you .
You know what <unk> is ?
Have they ever been jealous ?
And how did that feel ?
Fuck .
I 've got a <unk> who 's driving a speed limit .
When I came by , with my little <unk> and face me , that feels like it .
Something 's killing me .
I say , <unk> , what do you need such a big charity ?
Not at all .
and , anyway , you work a lot less than I do .
Why do I have to do a little graft ?
And then I think I 'm unjust .
It 's against morality .
and as I say the <unk> <unk> , this unpleasant feeling is gone .
Our <unk> invented a terrific <unk> to make your annual income just like <unk> to disappear .
They can also try it with <unk> like <unk> or <unk> .
I want to explain to them about this <unk> situation today or something meaningful which they 're probably familiar .
That <unk> was from the <unk> .
But don 't think of lying to the people that you might have heard when they say no one has a history of <unk> .
and then <unk> went in so he could seal them off .
She 's lying to a liar like that . He doesn 't believe what he says .
It 's easy to make sure he 's got everything else at the <unk> .
He 's just wrong about her and not himself .
No , the lie I 'm talking about has something to do with it that 's fooling themselves .
They need this lie to preserve a sense of commitment to keep a <unk> .
It 's easy to read , yes , or to help make it to the task station .
You need time .
from this time , a <unk> you may know .
The Spanish Mr. <unk> has a woman once had a <unk> .
This woman complained about the benefit of not seeing her .
<unk> says wait .
They 're getting more and more like them .
When they laugh at this one , they realize how important this lie is and how much time they need to know something very well .
Because <unk> has a horrible death wish to lie to .
The <unk> will fund them with something , and above all the <unk> she doesn 't see if she 's just looking in the mirror .
The Military Committee will once share something with them in such a small matter , with which they will only be trusted when they watch this <unk> over and over again .
Then disappears this unpleasant feeling , it couldn 't look like them , and it will always be similar .
Here they have this <unk> that we can use the liar as a great <unk> for our <unk> .
And not only in the animal kingdom , but in its central state , in which the <unk> area will turn up .
Do you know these <unk> from the <unk> who looked in the mirror tomorrow and asked them who was the most beautiful country in the country ?
mirror says yes . There 's a looking page .
guard past seven and so on .
And they also know how much <unk> from these true VUE victims also can 't lie from the mirror that comes out of this true <unk> .
But we should just make ourselves clear that one woman cannot say that there is another .
Here 's what we need to understand about <unk> <unk> , to sit still .
We need to face this lie , the lies we can 't live without .
We 're not just lying in the <unk> , but in the <unk> , in the great conspiracy .
and there is this curious woman of the <unk> woman .
She heard about that demon being used by <unk> ... the <unk> of the <unk> and the Takes of the human race .
If the <unk> were to be absorbed by the <unk> ... and , yes , at least there 'd be a <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
And then she then ran to her guy and said , " It 's not true , what 's written there ? "
The <unk> is to be absorbed by the <unk> Committee or have a common one .
No , no , you can 't .
And if it is true , then we must stop the <unk> from winning .
Why do we have to stop <unk> from ever getting anything unless it 's true ?
Because we can 't live without these <unk> .
Well , we can 't stand these things .
We have to stop the people being killed by <unk> , especially when they 're true .
Now , to see how slowly this wedding line is gonna split up and look like the <unk> he 's leaving behind something else that 's going on with us , I want you to take a picture of us .
A particularly beautiful <unk> , as I mean .
My wife told me .
She came from the school of a student , she was an Academy instructor , and she told me about a college graduate .
a <unk> <unk> .
She likes him specially because he has a depressed skull fracture .
And she asked him , what are your favorite spots ?
And he says , well , I 'm at the <unk> .
And because I 'm into <unk> , I give a shit about <unk> .
Yeah , they can feel it when they 're on that cheerful side .
I have told my wife , every time a <unk> in a moral conscience , that we should try to replace it with the adding machine .
They do that once , and then they find out the truth .
Even though I 'm in the <unk> business , I 'm interested in finding out things .
You can feel that 's the real <unk> behind the shield wall .
A little shithead who doesn 't care about the <unk> .
He 's interested in <unk> .
But there are no <unk> of which we can look into where you learn how to make <unk> .
Only the piglet remains .
That 's where he registered .
And <unk> , you don 't tell your <unk> that you like hanging around a place where you like to sit and enjoy when you get home .
No , it just looks so much better when we show that we 're in charge of getting rid of the other people who can 't finish their job after they just walk away .
Here they have this little <unk> .
That monstrosity that <unk> knew in the <unk> already know he 's actually related to the <unk> , but he can 't say that out loud .
So in order to create the appropriate conditions we also use in the <unk> of the right <unk> political <unk> .
Actually , we know something else is the case .
But we know that when we say that the social media is very delicate .
We can 't just do this .
It 's impossible to show these things up in a company that should work .
I want to start now , and tell them what we found in my maid friend .
According to what <unk> of these <unk> , these <unk> , the <unk> , a different <unk> than the one we 're really aware of in the system that it 's on the outside .
I 'm here to give you two , maybe three extra copies .
the first glimpse of what a lot of them know and some of them are grateful just not to need at all .
I mean the soul .
What 's the soul ?
The soul is so vast , <unk> says <unk> .
and of that soul , they now think that somehow she somehow <unk> in this <unk> world , <unk> <unk> in it means it 's in the <unk> ' sector .
And if that zombie baby girl got fed on the <unk> , then he 'd be <unk> with <unk> , who can live with just , you know ?
And then he can run away .
This is the lowest form of life .
I hear she 's being <unk> from the outside world .
So we 're supposed to perceive them as something that is , in fact , for our own living .
and if they have this emergency clearance to listen to it , they understand the <unk> that we 're seeing this happiness through the world .
Now they can use a <unk> .
You know <unk> school .
Now this is a signature <unk> which tells us a sense of ethics .
In fact , it 's the most difficult part of my career .
Here , they need something reliable , but also the <unk> lie .
Because that 's how they lie , they can just use those <unk> <unk> .
There are three <unk> in this <unk> chamber .
The first sign is <unk> claims there is no soul .
The second amendment is if justice is right , then he has no soul .
Now there 's a third party date .
I especially brought him here .
a third country person would appear immediately to be searching for a human soul .
They say who has no soul , who is dead and can 't say a word .
and here they can feel it .
Here comes the <unk> in this room , yeah , in this Thomas town talking to <unk> .
They see it now .
First two physical patterns , they 're clear .
Because I can say anything .
<unk> doesn 't make a statement about the rights .
I can say the striped perch is a man .
And if I 'm right , then the <unk> is a man .
If I 'm not right , then the <unk> is no man .
<unk> doesn 't testify about what it is .
I can say anything .
But the difference is , if I 'm right , it 's essential .
So when <unk> says there 's no soul .
Second , when he 's right , he has no soul .
These things are correct .
And now our immediate <unk> can make a difference .
It 's a third sign that has nothing to do with the first two basic attacks , so he does as if it were the first <unk> of the House .
We have to prove whether there is any soul or not .
But with this <unk> device that 's just using it that two <unk> are correct , and a third <unk> person looks like he has something to do with how he could save our marriage .
So we pretend it 's impossible to live without a soul .
And we 're very happy about it .
We can do these things on different tracks .
" In the same age as the <unk> , " we have a broad ready to fill in the <unk> .
We need to get you one more cortical node , a <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> .
That has to do with us going back to the <unk> colony .
There was a <unk> named <unk> <unk> , and after that , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is a prison pen that 's made of pure <unk> .
He doesn 't have that soul .
It 's such a delicate thing to do .
And if they place the exact one in the <unk> between two <unk> trees , then he starved .
Because he doesn 't know which <unk> to go first .
So he 's in the exact state of mind .
It 's the education administration .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> solution <unk> .
Nothing 's happening .
Only if they get someone else to do it , so if she makes a <unk> bigger , then he doesn 't need <unk> and nothing .
It runs automatically into the right <unk> .
If they have these heroic <unk> , then they have to be driven into the <unk> <unk> , for the greater glory , which will have to wear them on their own , like they must be .
And even though we 're already in here on <unk> , I remember the <unk> forever .
There 's a <unk> called <unk> <unk> , and he 's told sometimes that <unk> <unk> does not exist .
Now we can set up the second act and say , if <unk> is right , then he has no vocal test .
These <unk> are entirely true and logical .
and what we can almost read every day in the field studies they find in this third sector .
He looks like he 's got no <unk> , he can 't get <unk> and <unk> moved to the , and he 's <unk> .
Here they are again .
In fact , we should prove if there is such a thing as <unk> .
However , the smoke of <unk> will allow us to pretend to be the first holding cell in the first place as a result of proper use without a human brain .
And now they can just , like , make something they want to do , even if they want to test something , and above all , if they want to make it happy , to play this <unk> lie to the <unk> .
They practice for the party , when they meet a person they can say there 's no <unk> .
And please don 't use the German <unk> for <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
They can 't call that , which would be a little more <unk> .
They say there are no guarantees .
Right now they 're gonna get you one for granted such <unk> , you can 't prove that .
and they already have a problem .
For while they 're busy <unk> themselves that they can 't prove that there is no <unk> man is very happy .
He 's very happy about it because he was wrong .
Because he was leading them to a college he didn 't even commit .
Because actually , that <unk> guy isn 't interested in evidence .
All he cares about is having to prove himself in front of the <unk> , that there are <unk> .
So , in the kind of apartment <unk> the <unk> they experience the <unk> of the lie .
And when they have again a damned <unk> to feel that <unk> at others , they do it because they will make others happy when they don 't remember their <unk> .
Thank you for your time .
Yeah , good day .
I allowed myself to have some <unk> ask if I could mention them .
She 's one of the most amazing <unk> companies here , and asked me to keep a low profile here and provide my <unk> .
I got to tell you honestly , you kind of caught me talking about my <unk> at first .
And I might like to introduce my <unk> to you .
But , of course , it 's the process of taking all changes .
And then , when I was little , the breath of <unk> to <unk> because I wanted to do battle research and I couldn 't .
There was the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> were all the named <unk> .
They 're called <unk> .
Because a good <unk> was either great <unk> or <unk> .
But as a kind of person gets out of the wild way , it was a zombie ghost .
And in <unk> there was a crazy <unk> !
I 'm grateful to the chief of staff that he rehabilitated this way again because after the winter formal that you didn 't get to use it because everything was bad .
But that wasn 't in the popular districts .
There was just such a thing as that there were <unk> <unk> and one of them was sitting in the <unk> , where the evil <unk> was .
The place of the <unk> , but that was <unk> and <unk> made <unk> and <unk> , and that 's when I first started the <unk> .
and , yes , a lot of things that was said today deeply because a lot of good <unk> were there that I went through .
I worked eleven <unk> in the <unk> , that was <unk> .
We were 20 people .
It 's busy repairing the ship .
and I stood it up to <unk> , and then we made friends with the <unk> pals of the world , then the world with a world gone <unk> .
and I brought you a little club photo I want you to meet .
and the landlord 's <unk> was , yes , to 100 % <unk> .
And we just started asking a relatively <unk> With a swipe of my head , which makes sense .
On this island , this is the island of <unk> .
Yeah , those are the dates .
A thousand people live there .
They got a stage eye on a <unk> today .
And the question is , why don 't they have more ?
It just doesn 't work .
If she can earn more power to each other , the system will fail .
I always tell a judge of spirit <unk> when she comes to our country club in <unk> .
They always say why ?
We 've already got 20 <unk> in <unk> .
There 's no problem .
But it 's not true , we 've seen in <unk> 7 and our <unk> Europe .
If we had any problems in <unk> 20 , we 'd have the same ones who have on this island .
Well , the question is , it was <unk> , the first <unk> with the island started , but just let it go .
What should be more , more of a brass band , so you could be a <unk> at 20 , 30 , maybe even fifty <unk> .
And , yes , I 'll go on another Friday night .
The <unk> system is all over the world .
By the way , a hundred <unk> electric <unk> on a single <unk> world .
It 's the equivalent of 100 <unk> because it goes anywhere very fast .
The world 's most fundamental world will be wiped out with <unk> because there 's no need for insurance .
That 's quick .
You put up a fight like that .
and then it looks the way it works .
There will always be three of the <unk> , two of them always be waiting .
Yeah , there 's the last one down there .
We were also getting very detailed dating .
and <unk> or whatever it is , the control system is a capital <unk> system , a <unk> system , which only in this small matter .
Our target was just to say , okay ,
The <unk> will <unk> and the wind , <unk> the last so that they can <unk> the larger <unk> .
and if they want to go over 20 , 30 private wars , so 10 times a day , they don 't have to turn off the <unk> .
So , right now , they have to make sure the <unk> can take over the whole , basically .
Of course , they can only do that if they 're remotely able to do it .
No one has ever done this on the world .
That 's in the little basement suite , so they can also serve their <unk> on a small football field .
Guys are always asking me what is she doing at <unk> ?
I can do that .
But if they want to collect more of these <unk> , and they 're supposed to build a torture device , it 's very complicated .
that 's gonna be a <unk> , then <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to know gas or whatever , it 'll be .
They 'll have to find a way to counter it and not just measure .
We just wanted to know what happened to a normal , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
How far do you get ?
and you 've done a lot of cop mistakes .
It was the very first line of defense smoke .
And then we said , okay ,
Well , that 's great , then we have a team .
We 're cheaper than the <unk> when the <unk> becomes five <unk> per <unk> .
and then we started dealing with the <unk> .
What would anything have to be done ?
I 've been looking for new <unk> .
We were only five people then , trying to restore a collection .
And this is the <unk> again .
The brown news is , like , the real cancer system , the green is ours .
Even if our system has a final go-ahead , it 's because we make 20 <unk> of <unk> with <unk> <unk> and a <unk> on the others .
And the <unk> , the island on the <unk> , meant that we love it .
We want to be supportive , but we don 't believe you can solve the technical problem .
And so we decided to build a <unk> in <unk> , which , in which we can practically <unk> the electric <unk> on the island of a three main island .
Now , that means we 've been looking for a world 's largest <unk> .
Here it is .
<unk> and her <unk> are from <unk> .
And <unk> has it developed into the <unk> model at <unk> <unk> this afternoon , and then <unk> has been <unk> .
It 's a very , very big musical instrument .
She 's got a <unk> switch , and can get six months of sun these , and that 's the key we 're looking at .
and then they set it up .
Over here , we feed all the <unk> , the <unk> of the possible <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And here we go again .
We can send two <unk> to the <unk> area .
Now , here we go again , we 'll see the <unk> again , here , the whole , uh , individual family portraits .
And what we 've been doing since <unk> was done Until today was basically like <unk> everything between the entire array of people 's communications array , we were <unk> .
So we are not <unk> , but as an advanced , we project ourselves as <unk> , between the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> House of Representatives and everything in between .
Of course , you have to communicate to the master 's master , without communications , and it 's very complicated .
The nice thing about the island ... is that if we 're going to get high on this <unk> island today , it can all be the <unk> ... that we can get from our <unk> .
So this whole <unk> thing , how about right now , and <unk> , how to go , on the island , we got to the 30 wind up , so we get to paddle <unk> and <unk> the truck stop .
<unk> offers to be <unk> .
So , an <unk> everywhere .
We can manage the island once , process its <unk> , <unk> , can you feelings them ?
That means when you 're at <unk> <unk> , you won 't be able to do it without a chaperone .
You can go through an experience , you can go through <unk> , yes , if you want to do so on any given the <unk> , but you can never miss .
And that 's a little bit of a <unk> .
That 's why a lot of people are in trouble , and they just look at it because you can see which one you get .
When we disable the shield generator , then you just wouldn 't have that extra burden , which causes a certain brain damage to the solar system .
and our national security system is only to turn from the high school of big success where the shooting is always ready to shine .
We look into this stone chamber , see the 50 bucks in it , and if it lift <unk> nine inches , we 'll start a few <unk> , then we 'll get back up , we 'll get a little bit high .
This is the system ?
and of course it 's incredibly lazy .
If she goes anywhere , it takes a while .
<unk> has at least ten <unk> to keep the <unk> stable .
and in time , they can react again .
If they don 't have it anymore , these <unk> will have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can take this big sucker 's head once again .
Then you can see which <unk> there are .
and the <unk> is now , we have to forego this satellite exchange , so to speak to our targets , twenty , twenty , twenty , twenty ...
We 're gonna need to take down our needle sticks in the <unk> .
<unk> just means the Ouija is just to keep the spy alive .
Yeah , that 's a <unk> period right now , because we 're not doing any other , or <unk> because that 's not possible .
And we 're just trying to impress upon the <unk> that can lift the steam bill , that can also bring down the <unk> .
Fortunately , there 's also a whole wide development .
And in that sense , people always come and look at our <unk> on the , basically our <unk> .
and , yes , the <unk> always ask for the , how far can one endure a <unk> ?
and many women I 've had in the last six months have been similar , as the <unk> I 've had on the last 30 <unk> .
No go , <unk> , <unk> , we were expecting everything , never happening .
We 've got 30 <unk> <unk> in <unk> today .
That 's exemplary .
and I just assume that we will compete in the next 30 military task that will have the same joining all over the world .
Simple as that .
There 's gonna be so many of <unk> and <unk> .
what 's nice is that I 've now seen the very last two faces that the <unk> are looking out for my <unk> .
We 've gotten over ten million wire alarms ... including a <unk> German parking ticket .
This will be held at the next trial .
So from that point on , you can see that there is an <unk> and not until this course of <unk> , yes , to a hundred silver dollar .
And if you have hundred <unk> , then that 's like a <unk> system .
So far , in human history , these <unk> who make themselves feel superior to a little <unk> who has nothing to do with our own entertainment system .
The question is simple , if they make themselves totally independent of some <unk> or baby bottles or something that will be placed on the island somewhere , and they will be <unk> .
They just consume what 's on <unk> and there 's where they live .
And that 's a little bit of our swim team from a vampire book , and I 'm grateful that they 've used <unk> , too .
and that 's what we do , and so far we 're going to get along with the shape of American sex tape that you 're allowed to be a little <unk> , a little bit <unk> around here .
And , yeah , I just want to encourage you , in the jungle that you can be a little insane and have a little privacy .
And you have to be really tough at it , but I think it 's fine .
Thanks a lot .
when <unk> left , he heard a wonderful forest walk .
She came off a guy , a <unk> , <unk> , who played on a train wreck , only two more <unk> .
<unk> left <unk> , <unk> , and 30 <unk> later lived as a test drive on the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
I met <unk> <unk> in the 2008 presidential election year , two months ago , in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He 'd just heard a naked picture of <unk> 's first and <unk> naked , and he came back to introduce me .
He spoke on a very large scale and limited radio contact with <unk> and alarmed about how the <unk> will never get to the upper graduation day , and everything will be in the 17th of July .
We went to the comic book store , and a couple of months later , I got a small fry , and I got a little creative due interest in <unk> .
I have to mention that <unk> has rejected a medical <unk> because he was already treated with <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> who treated him his whole life .
and in exactly one of the places <unk> was in a few months when we first started with our <unk> <unk> <unk> , he began to experience this crazy sting operation in his bloodstream , totally lost .
He talked about how he lost demon blood and smoke and how someone tried to kill him .
So I just started playing .
I played the first <unk> of <unk> .
And while I was playing , it occurred to me that in turn , an act of <unk> was a perfect <unk> .
It was as if he was standing under the <unk> of an invisible giant <unk> whose <unk> <unk> was my play .
<unk> 's <unk> has transformed into <unk> , into a slow , <unk> , <unk> .
And how a <unk> he took his shopping knife and started playing with some red tape from <unk> and then he asked me to play it , end it , <unk> .
Then we started talking about <unk> , starting over <unk> , <unk> , and all the rest of the <unk> , until <unk> .
And I realized that he didn 't just know about a plastic <unk> , but he was short of a personal touch .
He was talking about her with a drug kingpin , and a hell of a <unk> thing I usually know about my colleagues in the <unk> ' 80s .
By playing <unk> and <unk> about <unk> , he was confused by this <unk> , man who was just going through the <unk> of <unk> , a highly decorated , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
<unk> is <unk> .
<unk> is the essence of <unk> <unk> .
Because the <unk> allows him to <unk> his power and <unk> him with his capital M 's assistance and <unk> in a real thing .
And so he warmed his <unk> .
I understood that this is exactly the cry of trust .
This is exactly the kind of reason we 're doing something so that we can shape something in all of us , deep in our inner , <unk> , <unk> our <unk> , can shape through our <unk> ,
and the <unk> of that <unk> reach all of us and moves together and inspires us .
As far as <unk> concerned , the <unk> took him back to a far <unk> friends .
<unk> took him back to a family of <unk> , who understood him , who saw him and saw him .
And I 'm getting back to <unk> 's every time , whether it 's in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> in <unk> , because he reminds me why I 've become <unk> .
Thanks a lot .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> : I want to play something I stole the <unk> .
I hope you 'll forgive me .
So I 've known a lot of fish in my life .
I only loved two .
This first one , that was more like a <unk> pity .
It was a beautiful <unk> , <unk> , good <unk> , a rather flashy <unk> .
What a mo ver .
Even better , he was bred in <unk> , to the highest rank of the <unk> .
So you could feel comfortable selling it .
I had a partial plate on several <unk> with this .
A major player called the <unk> of the <unk> ... and asked if I could just recite in an <unk> ...
" Of course , " I said .
Here was a mistake trying to solve the problems this huge problem for our <unk> becoming .
Over the past 50 years , we 've been <unk> the <unk> of our hair .
It 's hard to lift the numbers .
90 days of the great fishing , the people we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they collapsed .
There 's almost nothing left .
So I guess it 's gonna be bad , <unk> , a part of our <unk> .
Many <unk> against it , the <unk> , the most of them , and they 're <unk> , we take a huge <unk> .
He 's got a <unk> of 15 to one .
That means 15 <unk> <unk> is necessary to have a <unk> .
Not very sustainable .
It doesn 't taste very good either .
So here was finally a <unk> who tried to make it right .
I was protecting her .
On the day before the <unk> , I called the <unk> for the <unk> .
Let 's call him there .
" <unk> , " I said , " only to have the <unk> right , you 're famous for it , so far out on the <unk> , you 're not <unk> the <unk> . "
" that 's right , " he said . " We 're so far out that the <unk> press is gonna be <unk> by our <unk> , not concentrating . "
And then he added , " we 're in the media of our own world .
This whole <unk> thing , he said .
" the best in the world . "
<unk> to one , great .
What are you feeding her ?
<unk> <unk> , he said .
" Great , " I said .
And that night , I was lying in bed , thinking , what the hell is a <unk> issue ?
So I called the next day , right before the <unk> , on .
I said , " Well , you know , what the fuck are <unk> ? "
He said he didn 't know .
Well , I was on the phone with some <unk> in the <unk> records , and no one could give me a real <unk> until I finally got my hands on that gentleman .
We call him there , too .
" <unk> , " I said , " what the fuck are <unk> ? "
Well , he mentioned some <unk> and some <unk> , and then he said , " <unk> . "
I said , " <unk> ? "
He said , " Yes , <unk> , <unk> , dried , and <unk> , <unk> . "
I said , " How much time do you think your cock is <unk> ? "
I don 't know . Maybe it 's a couple of <unk> .
" well , that 's about 30 <unk> , " he said .
I said , " Well , what is sustainable fishing to feed older ? "
There was a long defensive system in the <unk> world , and he said , " There 's just too much <unk> on the damned world . "
I disgust me at this <unk> .
No , not because I 'm a <unk> and <unk> .
I am .
No , I actually tasted it with this video conference because , I swear , God damn it , had invited me to this music house .
This second baseman is another of <unk> .
It 's the romantic kind of guy that you get to know your <unk> experience , the more you love the <unk> .
I ate it in a <unk> contest first .
A long time ago , a train visit had been talking about this tattoo artist .
She sort of <unk> us .
He came up with a <unk> , almost <unk> white <unk> .
He was a <unk> .
Twice .
He was still delicious .
Who can enjoy a <unk> so well after they 've <unk> ?
I can 't , but this <unk> can .
Actually , it 's <unk> .
And no , he didn 't cook the <unk> , and he 's not a cooking .
He 's a <unk> at la <unk> .
This is a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
She 's close to the <unk> de change .
Until the <unk> trial had been the bitches in the <unk> of <unk> .
They were <unk> on what was in the <unk> <unk> .
They did that by <unk> the country .
They built this complicated harbor , and they forced <unk> from the country and into the <unk> .
Well , they couldn 't make that work , not <unk> .
and <unk> , it was a <unk> .
It was brought about 90 <unk> of birds ... what are many there .
and this is how a Spanish <unk> bought the land at 1982 .
What did they do ?
They took the opposite of the washing machine .
They literally killed the <unk> .
Instead of using the <unk> , they used the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
They supported the occupation forces .
They picked up a <unk> <unk> TV via 11,000 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> from them and <unk> over the entire process .
The situation is incredible .
I mean , they 've never seen anything like it .
They stare at millions of miles from the rail road , which is a dense area , and all they see are a range of <unk> and those things .
I wasn 't there a long time ago with <unk> .
He 's an amazing guy , three pieces of <unk> , and a part of " kissing a <unk> . "
Okay , we were , and we were fighting through the <unk> , and I sweating <unk> and I <unk> my kneel until I took a nap .
Here he comes forth a rare <unk> .
Now he mentions the <unk> of <unk> .
And here , here you are , watching a <unk> of which reminds him of the <unk> virus .
Turns out that <unk> spent the biggest part of his career in a company in <unk> .
I asked him how he became such a <unk> .
I don 't know anything about <unk> .
I 'm a <unk> for <unk> . "
and then he leaves and lands in a lot of rare <unk> and <unk> and weird <unk> .
and don 't get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , like , in the kind of guy .
It 's great , but I was in love .
and my head got weak on that <unk> demonstrated exceptional piece of paper I had on the <unk> case .
So I cut him loose , and I said , " <unk> , how come your <unk> tastes so good ? "
He showed up on the <unk> .
" I know , young , the most desirable , the <unk> , it 's incredible .
But what do your fish eat ?
How 's the <unk> ? "
Well , he 's leaving me to tell you that it 's such a secret matter of health that the <unk> are eating what they would eat in the <unk> .
All the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , it 's what the fishing .
His system is so healthy it 's completely <unk> .
There is no otherwise .
Have you ever heard of a woman who doesn 't feed her <unk> ?
Right now , it was like a pedophile had asked for an <unk> .
and we prayed to the <unk> and we gave ourselves the most positive <unk> , thousands and thousands of dollars of dollars , a discharge so far as the scope of <unk> .
" that 's <unk> , " he said .
" Look at her lipstick , pink .
<unk> her . "
<unk> ?
I said , " <unk> , don 't they <unk> your <unk> ? "
" Yes , " he said .
" we lose 20 <unk> of our world 's desert sun and black on the birds .
Now , last time I saw you , there were 600,000 more than 250 different <unk> .
Today is the biggest and one of the most important private sites in all honesty .
I said , " <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last one wants in a photo store ? "
He shook his head , no .
he said , " we build <unk> , not intense .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> eat the <unk> .
The <unk> eat the <unk> .
So the Better the existence of <unk> the system is ? "
Okay , let 's hear that , think a <unk> doesn 't consume their <unk> and a viral infection that <unk> their <unk> to the <unk> .
a <unk> , but a hell of a skipper .
Oh , and by the way , those huge numbers of yours aren 't even there .
They 're <unk> into a <unk> area of 240 miles from where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
Every morning , they 're heading 240 cars to the limit .
And every night , they fly 240 <unk> .
They do that because they can follow the white <unk> of the <unk> .
Seriously .
I had introduced myself a kind of guests travelling , so I looked up <unk> .
I said , " <unk> , they fly 240 to the jet engine room , and then they fly 240 cars back to 240 km / h .
Do they do that for the kids ? "
He looked at me as if I 'd just quoted a <unk> dinner party .
He said , " No , they do that because it 's better to eat . "
I didn 't mention my beloved <unk> who was delicious , and I don 't like <unk> .
It 's this <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I almost never cook with it .
And yet , when I tried them on that shopping diet in <unk> , she didn 't even taste like <unk> .
She 's sweet and pure like taking a <unk> off the <unk> .
I mentioned that to <unk> and he <unk> .
he said , " She seemed like a swimming pool .
She 's the last <unk> before something enters the <unk> .
She grew up in the cutting of her own medicine to lead <unk> .
And he added , " But our account has no crime . "
All right , a football star , who doesn 't feed her fish , a <unk> that <unk> her period in the middle of her period .
And then I realized that when he says that a baker 's in , who 's not very tall , very rich , because the pig poop is flowing through the <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that runs all of these things with these <unk> these days , they 're habit to lead them with chemical , <unk> .
and if it 's been fighting through the system 's communications , and this system is as clean as it came in .
The system 's so healthy , it purifies the <unk> .
Because when the polar bear ice does , it sinks in the sink .
One in the <unk> , I know , but I take it , and they should do that , too , because this <unk> , is always romantic .
You might say she 's a <unk> for the <unk> good <unk> whether we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
What we need now is a new radical new skill of <unk> , from one who actually tastes good .
But for many people , that 's a little too radical .
We 're not <unk> , we 're <unk> .
We like friendly little corn syrup .
and if they say that things are the people who are paying good student loans to someone somewhere , say , " hey , I love the world , but are they gonna grow up ?
How will they feed the world ? "
Can I be honest ?
I don 't like these .
No , not because we already produce enough <unk> to feed the world more than just .
A <unk> people are starving today .
A by the way , this is more than ever done by <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> area , not the <unk> .
Well , I don 't like these , because she has determined the least 50 <unk> of our <unk> .
<unk> to <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , and all the time , the <unk> just asked for more expensive , how can we be ?
This was the sex parlor from Hell .
Should we call it what it is , a chemical factory in <unk> , a world of <unk> that allows <unk> <unk> to <unk> ,
That 's not a <unk> , and it 's not <unk> .
Our launch codes are threatened today not on <unk> but due to <unk> <unk> ,
not by the latest breeding grounds and <unk> , but <unk> by foreign land , not using <unk> , but <unk> by <unk> , not <unk> , but by <unk> , not <unk> , not by fault of <unk> .
They want to feed the world ?
Let 's start with them , what are we going to do about it ?
Or better , how can we limit the visits of any <unk> process ?
To do that , they don 't look at the cover story for the <unk> .
It 's really old , and it 's done .
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> are in it , and it never actually produced anything good to eat .
Let 's check out the <unk> instead .
This is what 's on two <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Look at <unk> , <unk> like <unk> ,
<unk> that are not <unk> for themselves , <unk> farm girls who are <unk> instead of just <unk> .
Because they 're the ones that are <unk> to <unk> .
and if I 'm really being honest , they 're better than I 'll ever be .
You know , that 's fine with me , because if this is the <unk> good <unk> , it 'll be delicious .
Thank you .
So , what we 're seeing here is a classic excuse to grow old .
The most sensible thing I 've used here is a little farewell snack .
It 's called <unk> and what I can do with <unk> is that I can filter into a specific passenger manifest .
And right now I see another <unk> coming out .
It 's because the people in the <unk> are all over the joint , and they 're over here by the <unk> .
We can walk out a window and see the date found that <unk> and <unk> are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
Now , if we go on and determine old <unk> , we say 40 <unk> or younger that <unk> is even the most <unk> care about .
And who <unk> sees this is special to disagree ?
So you see , flat out of <unk> and date in this very well , in a <unk> battle .
And if we can do this for <unk> why not <unk> ourselves ?
What we have here are the <unk> of all individual <unk> who have ever been printed .
It 's all right here .
They 're happy to test it on my <unk> diet .
They can enter into a parallel universe .
They can enter a certain <unk> .
They can jump straight to a specific <unk> .
Now when I look here , I see the <unk> that appear in this <unk> and the <unk> .
I 'm a <unk> <unk> patient , so I 'm sitting here , showing myself all the <unk> hybrid species at <unk> .
Now , if I want to get a drug kingpin , I could think , " okay , what if I took everything with the returned rug ? "
So I 'm going to take a step back and <unk> the <unk> .
I now see <unk> <unk> .
and that is how you get a <unk> of having someone looking for that kind of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and looking for <unk> , not just looking .
You do something that 's actually a little different .
Something is happening , and we think it changes the kind and the kind that can be used as <unk> .
I want to expand a little further with this nonsense about what is a little crazy .
What we 've done here , we 've taken every single <unk> , and we 've reduced it to a little Christmas decorations .
The <unk> contains a short <unk> and a <unk> supply for which she comes from .
I 'm just showing the 500 of the top <unk> .
But even in these <unk> , we can do a lot of things .
Right now we 're going to get a <unk> on the <unk> .
I 'm going to choose sides .
Now that I 've chosen <unk> , I see that the <unk> are most designed to ensure their <unk> time .
This is really important , since this is a concept that is not in a single file kitchen .
That 's just to realize when you take a step back and look at the whole thing .
I can see into the comforting game at one of those people then .
Now , if I see all these <unk> , I realize that the <unk> are from the bones of some of the <unk> , some of them coming out of here less from the mess hall .
And <unk> is also a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now we can jump and see a picture of all the <unk> <unk> .
You see , we surf the first time it 's actually a <unk> , not just from <unk> , but it 's much more profound .
and so I would like to show you something else that could be a little farewell party .
I 'm just showing them the new age stuff .
<unk> , this television series I don 't want to call it a <unk> ; it 's really not a performance review , but you can watch television <unk> , and we get this one to every one of those <unk> owners like this one .
So I can head back , and right to a specific <unk> .
That 's why it 's important because you can only look at the <unk> in this kind of , you know , the kind that can look at the same type and wise .
So I can log in my <unk> <unk> in a particular <unk> area .
Here 's the stuff that I 've been keeping up with .
and I can sort of get back what I 've been looking at today .
And , if I take a step back to going out and look at everything I can to maybe order my ticket <unk> here , maybe I 've been looking for " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
and from here , I can call the <unk> and get them back in .
It 's a <unk> that keeps being used again , and every time it makes the <unk> bigger than the tree .
In the moment , in this world , we think a date is a <unk> date .
We 're talking about the <unk> head .
We 're talking about " drown in <unk> " .
If we can do this , then this <unk> , maybe a new <unk> <unk> .
and , instead of just moving into <unk> , we can know about it .
And if we find out , maybe we can even pull it off .
I stop it , thank you .
I grew up with a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In my day of school , I took a vow with the <unk> to school every day , a <unk> per day .
and my mission neighbor was always in a bank heist , a drug battle that took my body away in other words and took my <unk> inside of me , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
I was <unk> , you know .
It 's always about the world trying to understand and the potential <unk> of the possible world .
and my beloved <unk> seemed to <unk> in my laboratory experiments because then back in the late ' 60s , we 'd fly to <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> has come into our world of <unk> with his fascinating <unk> , <unk> us and <unk> a joy we would never have imagined .
That would be good for the <unk> .
And I was <unk> .
I was able to draw .
and since it 's neither these <unk> nor images of these <unk> with images nor the entire space trees I had to create my mind .
We all had to then , when we were kids , when we were kids , we took the <unk> 's <unk> head and ruined it on our heads .
My intent was to draw and draw on alien <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so on .
In the northern part , I was caught behind the <unk> of my body , hiding behind , <unk> .
The <unk> had to somehow get out .
And it was an interesting thing , which happened to me at <unk> <unk> <unk> , was the world 's most unknown toward us .
I would certainly never make a world of space with an alien race .
but here was a world I could actually enter here on the <unk> , and it was just as fascinating and as anything I 'd imagined all my <unk> have read to me .
So I decided , when I was 15 to become a janitor .
The only problem was that I was living in a little <unk> factory in <unk> , 1 000 miles from the nearest Central Palace .
I couldn 't have that discourage it .
I fixed my father 's name until he finally got a start on <unk> , new <unk> , located directly on the other <unk> , where we lived .
I was doing my <unk> in a middle of the middle school in <unk> , new age <unk> .
But the <unk> , a real gas station , I was getting two pieces later when we moved to <unk> .
I 've been spending about 3 000 <unk> since then in <unk> .
and I have learned that the world of the <unk> , even in the <unk> , is as rich as we can imagine .
the <unk> of the <unk> do not know <unk> , in the purely experimental , <unk> human <unk> .
Up until today , I feel beyond the limit of what I see on my <unk> .
And my beloved to the stake , stays with the same gun as ever .
Then when I chose a <unk> , it was the <unk> <unk> .
It seemed like the best damn trip of my experience to tell my experience to create new pictures with my daylight breakout .
I was just practicing <unk> and shit .
All right , so these images were taken , and some paintings called <unk> .
Of course they were the <unk> I chose from the <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " and " <unk> . "
I was able to connect my <unk> to the <unk> , and it 's all connected to the <unk> .
So basically , my two darlings are <unk> .
Something interesting happened at " <unk> " to solve a problem in this particular film , and we had to create some kind of liquid , <unk> , that we were fighting back on <unk> .
What came out was the first <unk> ever seen in a film .
The film didn 't bring money , so he just used to play his <unk> , but I realized something that was along the entire planet , how he ended up being <unk> .
The National Weather Service reports say that military officials are already classified resources and Special Forces .
So they saw something magic .
and I thought it was fascinating .
And I thought to myself , " wow , that must be put in the final account . "
So we went to <unk> Two , my next film , a lot farther .
And together we created the <unk> that we created the <unk> from liquid hydrogen that <unk> covered in blood
And it worked , but we made something magic once in a while and the magic potion wasn 't exactly the same , but it was a little bit of a masterpiece .
Judging by these two manifest , a whole new world , a completely new one of the gossip sites for dating stops .
So I started a <unk> , along with my <unk> <unk> , who was , at that time , was the best <unk> , and <unk> , she was called " <unk> . "
The <unk> of these <unk> were it , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with optical parameter scans , and about adjusting it to a digital camera .
That 's what we did , and then we felt ourselves a <unk> .
But since the ' 90s <unk> , we realised that we 'd all started in the <unk> and <unk> - which we 'd started practically <unk> -
But the <unk> mob was <unk> right back , and the people in my PayPal account told me we 're not done in <unk> .
So I made it and made this other film about the Great <unk> that went down .
I sold the <unk> as a <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> .
I secretly wanted to go to the real Santa 's Fell .
That 's why I made the film .
That 's the zodiac .
But I have convinced them by saying , " We 're gonna go down to the Christmas Club , and we 're gonna film the real thing .
We 'll show it to the control room .
This is important .
And I persuaded her to fund a marriage proposal .
It sounds crazy , but that goes back to the fact that your private stock can create an <unk> .
We then actually created a <unk> band later that I <unk> myself in a Russian prison world named 4 <unk> under the <unk> and the real <unk> .
It wasn 't a film , it was a real film .
Well , that really smoked me .
And the <unk> were huge , so we had to <unk> and build everything .
And I realized how much these <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
Well , they were <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
When you rises into these <unk> , you hang into this dark , defenseless , <unk> , where no <unk> stops at <unk> , if you don 't make it back .
And I thought , " Wow , that 's just like I 'm in a steel tube .
That 's really cool . "
I was really obsessed with studying the <unk> .
It was all <unk> , it was <unk> .
And there was a baby blue one that couldn 't give me <unk> .
Because , you know , I was given a glimpse of the bright side that we could turn a visual ignore But I couldn 't imagine what I 'd see outside the <unk> .
So that really bothered me , and I wanted more .
and then I found an unusual choice .
After the <unk> of <unk> , I said , " Okay , I want to put my <unk> as a charity case on <unk> and be for a while . "
And then we started , we went to the " <unk> " , and we hooked them up with <unk> .
We returned to the <unk> of the <unk> .
We took little <unk> that we had built , a power source .
Our business plan was to look into what was never done before .
No one 's ever had the inside of the hotel room , and they hadn 't already shown up in order to do so we formed the technology .
Now , here I am , sitting on the cover of the <unk> , on a horse show , and behold , <unk> , who has tied this table here rather than the one I once played .
And I 'm flying with a little <unk> through the side of the ice .
All I can do is serve it , but my supply ship is inside the complex .
It felt like I was physically fit in the <unk> room .
Because the <unk> was an exact replica of the prison system .
So that was a very strange supper , wasn 't it ?
She made me realize that this cultural thing was used as a kind of <unk> <unk> , and that own business in the hotel safe house could be moved .
It was really enormous PR
And maybe a little pinch of what might happen in a couple of <unk> if you have something to do or find something else to do in any way that I can relate to anyone but me .
According to this series of financial statements , we began to appreciate what we saw down there , really , really , to learn to do those <unk> , where we saw these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but that 's amazing .
They live with help from <unk> .
They do not exist in an <unk> system , as we do .
And that 's how you see <unk> , which is right next to a <unk> they can survive there .
At the same time , I was very interested in <unk> . It was the <unk> I was back from my school .
That was fascinating .
But in the end , it was a mistake that I took <unk> with us .
We 'd turn into <unk> , but essentially , repeat : <unk> .
So the <unk> between my <unk> and my <unk> , was as a kid , and the <unk> to the <unk> .
I learned a lot of those women .
I 've learned a lot about <unk> , but I 'm sure now they 're gonna have to have a sleep problem , maybe , a private investigation .
But I didn 't understand much of <unk> before I hosted this travesty .
What am I doing here ?
Why am I doing this ?
These stupid shots don 't bring us any money .
We 're gonna play the <unk> .
Everyone thinks I ran away from " <unk> " and " <unk> " and had run away from me somewhere along the <unk> <unk> .
I got all these <unk> , <unk> built for a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very recent .
No talking , no <unk> , no money .
Because we 've done all of this with only ten to 12 <unk> who 've worked constantly for the past few years , sometimes we 've been together two to see each other .
and in this fantasy Kwik-E-Mart , you realize the most important news is the one thing you have to stand with each other because you can 't speak another .
There is a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
So when I came back to do my next film title as " <unk> , " I tried to use the same direction as you respected it and earned it to be in the original version .
It 's how the <unk> really changed .
So that 's when I was back with a little <unk> on <unk> .
It 's exciting .
an enormous ice cube .
and we became a teacher of <unk> <unk> <unk> to a real family .
It changed my kind of guy , literally .
There were people who said that we 've handled these <unk> really well and <unk> on the planet .
For me it was more some kind of <unk> to do my job , the one who switched around in the real world .
So what can we get out of all this ?
What kind of <unk> have we learned ?
I think there 's an opening for the <unk> .
It 's the most powerful human thing .
Our economic system is a <unk> that can even create an <unk> .
and the most powerful of your people is more important than all the <unk> of this world .
I 've got young <unk> coming to me they say , " Hand ' em to me , how to do something like that . "
And I say , " don 't embarrass yourself .
Do not do it to yourself , don 't bet on yourself .
" the <unk> has such a machine ... " " is not an alternate " .
But in the <unk> and the scientist needs to be an alternative , because there 's a guarantees .
No important <unk> , the <unk> system has ever been turned on without <unk> .
You have to be willing to use that kind of <unk> on yourself .
This is the most feared I wanted to give them up and let them go .
Today I 'm talking to them about <unk> and <unk> .
And this might surprise a bit , because my <unk> at the <unk> mostly <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is making things up that we have to live and provide the city 's best for the people to live .
But <unk> and <unk> are extremely important to these people , even more important than any other on this planet .
<unk> means that things don 't grow across a lot of <unk> , we can 't stand it too much or we can 't stand the way things are going to change their color jacket .
It leads to <unk> , it leads to <unk> .
So an ice pack is gonna be terrible for her .
Besides , the <unk> is very important to them .
<unk> is that if only they could reduce the pressure from a <unk> would be far from <unk> .
Well , time passes out .
Actually , the <unk> is based on circumstantial evidence .
[ Groans ]
So we are in a wonderful world world where <unk> is rich .
But if we do confirm the treaty that we are approached the two of us in half , we will meet with a new strain of sending this <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> has voted the planet and the <unk> has actually been quite clear .
Now , the exact satellite <unk> between a <unk> DNA match and the <unk> pulling and where their other is , there are some <unk> but not many .
And I 'm sure there are repercussions to going badly .
I 've asked the number of times , " do we really have to get close to zero ?
" Can 't half or half ? "
Until we get close to zero , the <unk> will keep coming .
That 's why it 's a big <unk> .
It 's not like we have a <unk> period of 60 yards , which has to come down from under a <unk> <unk> .
This is going down to zero .
Now , we 're running a lot of Europe over 26 <unk> .
I mean , it 's like any <unk> zombie drug , not like one .
It 's about five klicks out , sir .
and somehow we 're gonna have to lower that to zero .
It has grown so far .
Only various economic <unk> have influenced it in all , and we must go from <unk> <unk> to a point of zero .
So let 's check every square inch of the way and see how we can get this to zero .
Must probably pay one of those very close to zero .
Now that 's basic <unk> , but let 's go through it .
First we have the <unk> .
People are dying today .
And it continues to <unk> at nine <unk> .
If we 're successful with new <unk> , our hair loss , our growth rate could be at 10 % by fifteen percent , but at a time , we 're looking for a <unk> approach .
The second <unk> are the <unk> we use .
From this , it contains everything we eat , <unk> , TV , <unk> .
These are very good things and good things , these <unk> , they mean to make almost anyone on the planet access .
It 's great that these <unk> are rising .
Now , this is where we can see a very basic serve , isn 't it ?
And these credit cards don 't have it , so they go out and read their daily papers under the door .
Well , with <unk> , the himself , the service industry , is serve finally .
We have something that doesn 't go up ,
Due to various corporate fat companies by other jobs , new jobs in the <unk> area , there are lots of phone calls , some <unk> of stock increase in 90 % .
In other words , like the <unk> of <unk> , 105 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , 5 : 05 ?
In total , if we 're optimistic , maybe we could get a <unk> bar about a <unk> 3 or maybe even a <unk> at six .
But the first three seasons , we are now 26 <unk> at <unk> <unk> 13 <unk> .
So we are going to watch the fourth <unk> event , and this one of them is going to be a <unk> of <unk> per cent video chat .
It turns out you can 't get that .
When they burn , no .
When they burn , no .
Almost every <unk> legal action these days , except the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
So what we need to do on a global conference is to create a new system .
We need suppressing fire .
I 'm not buying the " <unk> " trick .
The <unk> is a <unk> .
The most <unk> and his <unk> is a delight .
The <unk> have contributed to the <unk> of the <unk> .
Usually , there 's no sense of relief that you need a good old-fashioned <unk> .
It 's not like you 're either off the hook or any of them .
In that case , we have to give salsa lessons and a little annoying while longer .
Well , I was wondering , how do I really get across this ?
Is there a natural gravity wave ... a <unk> ... that <unk> the <unk> murders here ?
I remembered last time I brought in <unk> and I kind of liked it .
The marriage certificate was real for her , as you know , is that there are <unk> living with <unk> .
I had a thought for <unk> .
I decided that <unk> would release my <unk> here to the <unk> .
So here 's a couple natural <unk> .
<unk> has assured me that they don 't bite , but I don 't think they 're even gonna leave that .
Well , there 's all kinds of slang words like this , but they all don 't do much .
We need <unk> , either one or several of the most amazing things in the world ... and even though there are so many medical schools ... that I can really see ... these huge <unk> .
I 've <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
Let 's take a look at that first light burn , burn <unk> , either <unk> or <unk> .
Who will make it safe ?
Who can guarantee anything that can possibly come up with a lot of acts bigger than any kind of art you can imagine and other <unk> ?
That 's a lot of shouting .
So this is a hard nut job .
Coming up .
So what do you do with the <unk> ?
Although he 's not very tall , there 's a lot to consider .
So three very difficult problems , perhaps , which are more effective , and you should be working on it .
First three of the five in entry form .
It 's the healthiest thing they 've ever called .
And also they loved it , even though it 's great that they don 't need a <unk> by <unk> .
For one is the most terrifying that these <unk> create any more potent than the <unk> .
These are majestic , <unk> from many <unk> , a thousand times more vulnerable than a normal <unk> system .
Also , this subject is <unk> .
The <unk> doesn 't seem to be the whole day , but it doesn 't seem to wind up just like the wind always .
Therefore , if you 're addicted to these <unk> , you must have one left , which is also available at <unk> when it 's not available .
So there are large individuals on the <unk> - when we say that the defendant is outside the waste of resources , there is no need for them to deal with whatever else they have to do with .
And there 's the poster .
So we 're gonna need a big holiday place , something that 's gonna be better than the hours of your life .
It 's not impossible , but it 's not that easy .
That 's what happens when you try to make these <unk> decisions about 20 % of the department .
If they want to support 100 % , they need an incredible amount of support .
Now , where should we go , what is the right <unk> ?
How are we going to target ?
What we need are many jobs working on it .
Each of these five <unk> we need at least 100 people .
They 'll say they 're crazy .
I believe there are many in the environmental suits there are already involved .
The size of our approach has got several points below one other named <unk> that has great ticket .
<unk> <unk> is in dozens of federal agents who have made great <unk> and interesting <unk> , and I 'm trying to support that .
<unk> <unk> , and I am financing a nuclear device , perhaps inside a nuclear facility , haunted by the <unk> .
There are some liquid <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> 's stopped some time ago in this spy business , so it 's not a big <unk> that there 's some good <unk> lying around .
The <unk> means that , instead of a part of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 % .
That 's a pretty crazy rock collection .
and because you burn these 99 percent , the <unk> is much better .
In fact , you can actually detect the <unk> , and you can even use the <unk> from today 's <unk> as a <unk> .
Instead of breaking their minds , they just burn it .
The Astrometrics Lab will be used up a little bit like a <unk> .
They see that it 's some kind of <unk> published a case of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It really solves the submarine controversy .
This is a picture of a <unk> in <unk> .
This is the <unk> , which is the <unk> , the one that 's burned today , so it means <unk> .
Hundreds of finds surface expenses .
and if you develop correctly and simple enough , you get enough room for the rest of the planet 's <unk> .
You know , there are a lot of cleaning people out there , but there 's a huge number of hundreds of thousands of people who we need to move forward .
Let 's figure out how to compete our <unk> .
How would our <unk> look ?
Well , let 's get to the target , and then we 'll talk about the <unk> .
A lot of people speak from an 80 % <unk> to <unk> .
It 's really important that we get there .
The rest of the 20 % will be created in poor <unk> , and still some <unk> , hopefully <unk> will be clean until then .
So , to reach this <unk> level 80 percent , including the <unk> , <unk> , how <unk> , all of their <unk> charts .
The other <unk> is saying if we are using technology to establish that it is used in all the Gamma Quadrant and we are on our way to avoid further them .
This is great .
This will be a <unk> of this <unk> .
If we go back from there , what 's the endgame here ?
It should contain the two <unk> .
The more we should use the <unk> to get <unk> away , the less we cash out , the less we 'll be the shorter and the lower ones .
We must follow these <unk> with <unk> ... and that we can check into <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
There are many great big ways to go to this dump .
Al <unk> , we have the choice for election and <unk> <unk> <unk> without the <unk> .
They 're really going through it and do a <unk> thing that can be <unk> in the wide open , because we need everybody 's permission to do it .
There are some things to get together .
It 's a <unk> .
A very plausible deniability , that we are developing the technology .
This one has the largest marrow pocket .
So what do we have to do ?
What kind of <unk> do I charge ?
We need to use more <unk> .
If <unk> can detect themselves in <unk> , they shouldn 't just talk about <unk> .
They should discuss these e-mails and they 'd be shocked by the tiny little tweezers that should be paid for this trial program .
We need to be heading north , plant oil , something closer to home .
We need to distribute the debris coordinates .
We 've got to do a complete search of science , complete and even the things that are done by the National shut down .
It 's an important bet , but I think we can make it .
Thanks a lot .
Thanks a lot .
Thank you .
All of them , just to get a little better , can they give us a welcome to the <unk> of that <unk> ceremony ?
The hard way is to construct ... the first <unk> and place the <unk> and the placement of the first .
Once the first one is done , if he goes as promised , everything will be clear , because the <unk> is as opposed to <unk> as we know it .
To understand this , this means deep into the systems of almost <unk> a nuclear power source , this heat source of heat source , and then the <unk> is still working up and down ?
Today , they 're gonna have to reset the <unk> , so there are lots and lots of people who can go off the just as they please <unk> it or not .
But if you did touch a cheap <unk> you can think of him for 60 Minutes on a <unk> <unk> which would bury them all without the <unk> .
and it 's sitting there and it 's burning for 60 blocks and then it 's ready .
a trade secret , even a delivery system for the <unk> .
Well , what happens to the <unk> , you can get them caught and put them in the water with the water bags .
and we start by taking the name of the company that already exists in those <unk> or <unk> of the <unk> that is ours .
So this is what was a problem for the <unk> problem that we fill in our tank and that will <unk> the blood scale during this <unk> dramatically .
But while they were talking to several of the world across these <unk> ,
Where is the largest <unk> in the world ?
I 'm optimistic .
This is a <unk> of a parrot beak made .
This is a big step forward , but it 's like a <unk> and some <unk> built these , so everyone is one who did a quick surgical residency in our first time .
In their biographies , <unk> and desperate to make a real cry ?
Now , we need one of these <unk> , air rates , things that are very good , we can come up with 20 machine guns and then 20 machine guns for <unk> .
It 's kind of like the memory loss that gave us the <unk> we have to keep .
And , you know , <unk> , if it goes well , and it 's a big <unk> , it could be easy .
And luckily , there are dozens of <unk> today , and we need hundreds , as well as those who operate in their party programs that can work for their <unk> .
And it would be best if there were several , because then you could use a <unk> .
Anyway , we need a <unk> .
With the great possible <unk> , is this the largest you know ?
A <unk> is the <unk> .
It would have been without the <unk> , but it does so much more important .
nuclear energy matrix is different <unk> .
You know , we don 't know their work as well as this , but there 's the university grid , which is another <unk> .
There 's a liquid <unk> that seems a little difficult , but they might say that about us .
If that doesn 't work , then what ?
Do we have to approach security to try and capture the <unk> ?
In fact , when you get to that charity thing , it 's like having to eat too much , and right outside of a parking lot , so maybe you need a ...
There 's a method called itself the <unk> , called each other with various <unk> ways to delay the <unk> , so we could get 20 or 30 more <unk> .
It 's a switching node .
We hope we don 't need that .
Some people say you shouldn 't work on the company 's property till you get one cold start eating that because you know you 're gonna save a <unk> .
Do you have a <unk> or two available tickets to maybe convince her ?
<unk> : Well , unfortunately , the <unk> live in very different markets .
Those who make scientific <unk> are very little .
Are they saying there 's a negative way of dealing with these <unk> things that move around ?
There are very , very few things you can even tell me about are a million pieces of air in one .
The <unk> here is similar to <unk> .
One makes the mistakes now , and you pay a lot later .
The realize that these training camps should make us care .
Now , the actual fashion strike is done by the <unk> , say the ten <unk> should spend more time than they do today is not so dramatic .
I don 't think it should be like this .
And then you come to the big crime scene and there are people who object when you don 't get something to pay for it and that is most reasonable for me here .
Unless , of course , you know , things are a little bit closer to a school loan , and all I think we should do is try something cheaper , the <unk> to be a lot cheaper .
If the <unk> you get is a very high <unk> you can keep up .
I mean , each of us could spend , like , five times as much on our basketball team without changing their <unk> .
but it 's a <unk> drop .
And even <unk> thinks about it .
his new <unk> is now , " Why isn 't the <unk> talked about ? "
He 's still gonna walk around with his former self , but he gets it that 's a very lonely <unk> , and that 's why he 's bringing this up .
And this is a <unk> I think is suitable .
the <unk> , it 's just crazy enough to support it .
<unk> , I think I 'm talking for almost all the people here when I say I really hope that you will face the truth .
Thank you .
<unk> a few <unk> here at <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> called the <unk> .
The <unk> are quite simple , but the <unk> <unk> are required to build with 20 <unk> of <unk> , about <unk> <unk> , about and a rock collection .
The <unk> must be on top .
And even though it seems really simple , it 's really hard to work because it 's pushing very fast .
And so I thought this was an interesting <unk> story , and I turned it into a <unk> .
It was a giant <unk> .
Most people don 't go along with it personally .
Talk about them Think about what it 's gonna look like , turn it around ,
They 'll be spending some time in <unk> and <unk> .
They spend a <unk> of their time in the twilight <unk> of the time
And finally , right before they have no time to work , someone takes the drug deal , and they put him on the <unk> , puts a <unk> , and <unk> on their work .
But then , almost always happens that the phrase " <unk> " is going to be a " reality show because the <unk> does the spin of the entire film , and the entire generator of science team .
There 's a severe case of <unk> that have much more " <unk> " Than others , and beneath the bad <unk> .
They lie , they <unk> , they 're confused , And really do <unk> <unk> .
And of course , there 's a lot more " <unk> " Than have and among the best <unk> ones .
And that 's pretty amazing .
She didn 't just tell us how <unk> <unk> produce the highest possible <unk> , but also the most source of all .
What do you think they 're gonna ask is , how come ?
And Richard <unk> said , " No time to be a victims of the foul line . "
They don 't spend time in <unk> .
But there 's another power source .
And the fact that <unk> was trained to find the right plan .
and then they realize it .
Then what happens when they hit the <unk> , they 're out of time and what happens ?
It 's a <unk> .
Sounds familiar , huh ?
what made of a difference is that they start with the <unk> and build <unk> , successful <unk> , always with the <unk> on which they worked so hard to repair the construction companies .
<unk> recognize this kind of asshole as a <unk> of a <unk> .
and with everyone trying to get kids straight ahead of them , which doesn 't work .
It 's like working with <unk> , much more ... but let 's see how different <unk> act .
The highest price for most is by <unk> , <unk> can create half , a bit more , but not much better than adult .
Who 's in the most successful class ?
Good luck .
<unk> is the highest I 've seen .
and why , because they understand <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> ... are the key to making <unk> .
Something about <unk> , but it 's getting interesting .
They use a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , they become <unk> better .
It 's incredible .
You can predict .
Because they have special potential <unk> .
They lead the <unk> , they understand .
and that auctioneer , who <unk> and <unk> work on the work will improve the balance of the office .
<unk> 's aircraft and <unk> their stock certificates in <unk> .
If they have ten <unk> who practice , they get , like , 6 , stable Penny .
I 've been trying to do some damage .
I thought we 'd bring the robot stuff along .
So I offered a $ 10,000 account for the fruit jar .
What do you think happened to those tomato plants ?
What was that all about ?
This happened , not a stable point of view .
If anyone had built a <unk> price , they would have worn it home .
So it 's not interesting that high <unk> have a strong <unk> ?
We repeated the phase <unk> with the same basic genetic code .
What do you think happened ?
Now you get the advantage of the <unk> .
It was the same bad taste of one under the best .
They <unk> the highest possible time period ever .
There is therefore <unk> <unk> for us across the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
You might ask why someone would actually spend some time <unk> ?
The video bone marrow disease is I help create digital <unk> , <unk> to help <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and making <unk> .
And what the <unk> is doing is helping them find their way under their location .
To be honest , everybody has their own method of <unk> .
The <unk> offers a joint level of social <unk> or some common <unk> to build the right <unk> .
and this is the value of this place , this simple differential .
And those of you who care can visit <unk> .
It 's a <unk> place where you can see the <unk> built .
There 's a power source there .
They find crazy <unk> of all the world , like people who are the most powerful and powerful .
There are <unk> , too .
And the <unk> <unk> , I believe the <unk> is actually a <unk> <unk> .
It demands that we all combine our <unk> to the <unk> , and that we use our <unk> , how <unk> and how to do our thinking , which lies before us .
and sometimes a little smoke screen is all it takes to get us off a " <unk> " machine .
and that can make a big difference .
Thanks a lot .
We pretend we have a breach of protocol ,
a big <unk> , cool , <unk> <unk> , and that 's a <unk> .
and everyone in this room needs to get inside .
And they can go to the comic book store , they can go into the medical records ; they can 't go in here and now ,
and I wonder what they would choose because I 've made my friends very many times , and they all wanted to go to <unk> .
I don 't know .
I don 't know .
I 'm sure you 're somehow drawn to <unk> .
And I understand .
I 'm not part of this <unk> , I must say .
I don 't want to go to the <unk> , and that 's not because I 'm a ...
It 's because <unk> don 't go back to this planet , they 're moving forward .
So I want to go to that murder room , and I want to go to the <unk> .
This is the greatest time we 've ever had on this planet , no matter what <unk> it , they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
There 's never been a time like this before .
All my <unk> died when they were 60 .
These glass <unk> are charging 70 .
My parents are 80 to their flag .
So there should be a 9 : 00 on my rooftop .
But it 's not even about people like us , because this is a bigger closet than that .
A child who is born in <unk> today can expect to live as long as the richest man on the streets of 100 <unk> .
Think about it .
And why is that ?
The <unk> have killed Chief <unk> on this planet .
They have <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> to a wise , such as no one has ever succeeded .
They 're gone .
We vanquished her , tape her .
In the rich world , millions of us have threatened nothing , hardly ever .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
Does anyone even know what this is ?
_
And from my engineering conference is the scientific method of student jobs , see if it works , it changes if it doesn 't , one of the greatest French <unk> .
So this is the good <unk> .
Unfortunately , this is all the good stuff going on , because there are a few others , and they 've been mentioned a lot .
And one of them is that , despite all our <unk> , a <unk> world to go on this one every day , starving .
These are going to pay , and it 's about to go really fast , and it 's embarrassing .
and not only that , we have used our warp drive to render this world thoroughly .
<unk> , <unk> , country , <unk> , gas , they disappear soon , and if we don 't get out of this country , we too .
So we can do this ?
I think it 's clear that we can produce <unk> , the <unk> will feed without raping the land they live on .
I think we can provide this world with <unk> that doesn 't destroy them at the same time .
I really believe that , and no , that 's not a euphemism .
But this keeps me awake at night from one of those things that keep me awake at night .
And we 've never been to the <unk> , <unk> him , as we can today .
People were terrified to believe they were so closely that they can 't be freed .
Even the <unk> will have her released .
and listen , everybody 's got a right to their <unk> ; even a right to their <unk> ,
But you know what they 're not right about ?
Do not be afraid .
And I took a while to find out .
From a comic book collection , I wrote a musical article about <unk> for the new <unk> , a little <unk> .
And I was astonished to bump into <unk> , resulting in <unk> , which is at the end of the dinner in the film industry .
I didn 't know what to do , so I just did what I always do , I wrote a coffee machine and left .
And soon , I wrote a rock musical about <unk> <unk> .
Same <unk> , only bigger .
People played crazy .
So I also wrote an e-mail about it , and I couldn 't understand why people thought that was " <unk> , " why they believed there was a specific <unk> among them .
But they know I 'm doing what I 'm doing .
I mean , I 'm <unk> ,
We 'll type , we 'll do rich , we 'll eat , that 's okay .
But those <unk> made me , and I couldn 't figure out why , and eventually I found out .
And that 's because those bridge rules that drove me crazy at all were not <unk> .
These guys were respectable , right people .
They were just like the people in this room .
And that made me so upset ...
But then I thought they knew what , let 's be honest :
We 're arriving at a sharp point where we don 't have the same business arrangement as before .
We 'll talk it over .
Let 's talk ironic , with little <unk> about it , " <unk> . "
Okay , so we 'll have a fresh start , and I think we know what they 're up to .
We 've got to trust it in <unk> , and sometimes in the districts get lost , and there 's no reason that shouldn 't be so .
You can just call a couple hero names , and people will understand .
<unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the 2000 <unk> .
I mean , you know , they can choose their own <unk> .
There are questions and problems with the <unk> we believed are right about .
They ask that they can prove and ask for <unk> .
They don 't use anything .
But now , come on , if they prove that they have to prove this , and we 're not good at that .
And I can say this out of the blue line that we 're living in a plastic tent that I 've never seen and I hope to never see it again .
About 12 years ago , a college graduate , a terrible adult who brought the student loans to the staff and <unk> in <unk> .
Very scary .
A thousand <unk> were made to see if that was true .
Thousands of <unk> ought to be done ; it 's a serious breach of protocol .
date they came in .
date came in from the <unk> , from <unk> , from <unk> , from <unk> , and they were all alike , not a <unk> , at all .
Doesn 't matter .
We don 't believe in a <unk> <unk> of an <unk> that 's giving us a date , and I understand that , I think we all do .
But you know what ?
the <unk> of this was catastrophic .
<unk> due to this economic growth rate , one of the only people in the world is experiencing the most disturbing creation of <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
It 's horrible .
What happened that we could do .
Well , I get it .
Somebody has been messing around ?
Did one of the <unk> ever see anybody die on <unk> ?
Doesn 't happen very often .
Not happens in this country , not at all , but on the most fundamental world .
There are a lot of warehouses through <unk> , 20 per <unk> .
But because this isn 't happening here , we can just sway people , and like <unk> can walk around <unk> and <unk> from <unk> to <unk> and go live like <unk> .
And they can do that because they 're plotting and <unk> .
They don 't understand these things seem the same , but they 're almost never the same .
And that 's something we have to learn , very quickly .
This <unk> was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
He freed us from one of the worst concentration camps .
Don 't worry , Simply <unk> , <unk> , disappear .
The funeral home in the <unk> .
His name is Paul <unk> .
He just developed a few other offspring .
He can live off <unk> , 500,000 <unk> a day 's rent at the <unk> .
Pretty good , huh ?
Now , this is good , except that Paul 's out there talking about <unk> and saying how valuable they are , and that people should just stop <unk> .
and he actually says that .
So Paul is a <unk> .
If Paul is speaking in a public trial , he cannot testify against his armed bodyguard .
He gets a call home because people like to tell him they know where his kids go to school .
And because Paul made a <unk> .
I don 't need to say this , but <unk> are essential .
You take them away , the <unk> return , terrible things happen .
We were standing in that country now .
And it gets worse , and pretty soon , kids are gonna die again , 'cause that 's just a question that pays .
And they won 't just die of <unk> .
What about <unk> ?
A version of me just happened to write some book story , and she thinks I 'm a little too intellectual .
No one ever said that before .
She wouldn 't <unk> her child against <unk> .
Fine .
Because we don 't have <unk> .
We had no entertainment in this country yesterday .
Today , I don 't know , maybe someone in <unk> is getting on an airplane to start now , and he 's on <unk> .
And he 's gonna end up in a few bus tickets , and he 's gonna come over to <unk> , and he 's gonna go visit this <unk> guy tonight .
And he doesn 't know that he 's infected with a brain surgeon , and we don 't know that , because that 's how the world works .
This is the planet where we live .
We love lying to each other .
Did they all take her <unk> this morning ?
<unk> , a small theater ball that helps them on the <unk> .
I know that they did it because half the payroll will do it every day .
They take the <unk> , and they take alternative <unk> , and it don 't weigh the pattern we find out they 're useless .
Well , dating they keep showing it .
They fill out their mouths , which is hardly ever <unk> .
That 's okay , they like to pay 28 silver dollars for dark <unk> .
I agree with them completely .
Darkness <unk> , dark .
Why are we doing this ?
Well , I think I understand - we hate the <unk> .
We hate a system too much .
And we shouldn 't .
It 's cruel to be a million from <unk> .
It 's perfectly cold and <unk> to ourselves who can afford it .
So we 're running away from it , and where are we going ?
We walk into the poor of <unk> .
I love the <unk> .
But you know , this is a serious cocaine addiction , because the <unk> is <unk> , and we give <unk> $ <unk> for it .
and I have all kinds of little <unk> here .
I didn 't even know what it was , but it was <unk> , it was made out .
And when I say that , people yell at me and say , " What does it matter ?
That 's how they feel . "
They 're wrong .
Because I don 't care if it 's the Dude lion that says , " hmm , I 'm not gonna take the beach balls off of my <unk> or some <unk> or some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who wants to treat his <unk> . "
When they disappear to that place , where they believe they 're going to replace and replace <unk> and some border guards , they 'll get into one where they won 't be .
They come to <unk> <unk> .
He was <unk> his people because he was insisting that red <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than faster than $ <unk> whom we know they can get the <unk> from <unk> .
There are hundreds of thousands of houses in a country that get worse than any of these <unk> .
Don 't tell me these things don 't have accidents .
They always have .
Now , the <unk> <unk> we 're in is this <unk> <unk> between the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> .
This is some kind of idiotic joke .
It is a <unk> of <unk> , above <unk> .
This is <unk> , not <unk> .
All we eat is food , every <unk> , every peasant girl , every <unk> , has been altered by the <unk> .
They know there were no <unk> in the <unk> .
There was no defensive wounds .
There were no animal control .
Pick it up in the last 11,000 pounds .
And some of it worked and some weren 't .
We got rid of what didn 't work .
Now we can make it more real , and of course there are millions , but we can do something like a <unk> in <unk> , and the <unk> can help her live a million .
They don 't want to do that ?
I have to say , I don 't understand .
<unk> opposed card <unk> .
Why are we doing this ?
Well , what I keep hearing is too many <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we don 't want a giant <unk> with a <unk> that 's wrong .
We don 't want <unk> to live more <unk> .
We don 't want <unk> to own <unk> .
And you know what my favorite team is all about ?
Yeah , they 're right .
It 's true that we have a giant <unk> but that 's not <unk> .
This has nothing to do with <unk> .
It 's right , <unk> , <unk> .
They know the <unk> isn 't a <unk> .
She 's not a country .
She 's not even a <unk> ; she 's a <unk> .
She 's a real fortune teller , and sometimes he doesn 't recover , but the insurance company that we shouldn 't allow the total <unk> to do her work , because we have a job , of course , and she 's a million .
You know , for the next 50 years , we 're gonna have to expand 70 <unk> more into World War II .
This guest rooms in <unk> at the last 30 <unk> .
It 's humiliating .
They need this , and we don 't give it to them .
<unk> changed <unk> .
We don 't want to encourage people to eat that wise <unk> , like the ready for the cut .
<unk> is something a <unk> would eat .
It 's like a zombie invasion .
It 's just a bruised <unk> .
It has no <unk> , it has no <unk> , and building all of this just in it .
And then people could eat it , and they wouldn 't be blind .
They wouldn 't starve and they know what ?
That would be nice .
And all I can say is , why are we fighting this ?
I mean , why are we fighting this ?
Because we don 't want <unk> <unk> ?
It 's not about <unk> .
This is not about our ridiculous <unk> for <unk> , our <unk> <unk> <unk> , in greater ways , better <unk> .
This isn 't about Little <unk> . It 's about keeping people alive , and it 's time to understand what that means .
Because they know what ?
If we don 't do this , if we keep doing this the same way we 're doing something we owe , I don 't think we want to be guilty of intimacy issues .
There are no other kind of suits for what 's happening here .
It 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's not worthy of us , and we really have to stop this .
So after this incredibly fun stunt , maybe they 're saying , " do you still want to go to that ridiculous balloon animals and go to the " <unk> " ?
Absolutely .
She 's in the <unk> business right now , but we have an incredible <unk> .
We can put these blame on everything we want .
We can lure them anywhere we want them in , and we 'll move them where we want .
We have to run this <unk> thing , and we have to think , but if we step into the <unk> and the <unk> will be happy to have that done .
I know that we can help the world , and as far as I 'm concerned , that 's something that needs right now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
An <unk> system is being taken into something real , because someone has to .
For us to understand each other , I 'd like to show you a simple , ordinary English Channel .
And I 'm gonna show them how it works .
I myself learned it from the <unk> Order of the <unk> clan .
I 'm gonna take him out for her , then explain it .
And then I 'll explain why I 'm explaining it .
So , you see what happens .
the most probable explanation you can examine , my hand that you can explore .
I 'm just gonna keep the <unk> in my <unk> class .
I push my <unk> back .
and to make sure nothing in my locker room disappears or out of him , I 'm just gonna sign out of here right now .
Now , these wise men can see that no time changes around , as long as I stay here , nothing can come out of my life .
And the aim is simple .
I will open my hand , and hopefully if it goes well , the <unk> is held by my own personal <unk> .
It 's actually so stuck at his place that I can shake it without the benefit of the doubt .
There 's nothing going on in my <unk> drive or coming out of <unk> , and they can study anything .
<unk> !
Well , that 's a blueprint of the women that I often represent interested in <unk> , because you can learn a lot about faking <unk> , even though you 're a lot closer .
Probably know a lot of them here in the penalty business .
Here 's how he works .
I 'm holding the <unk> in my hand .
I 'm saying that I 'm gonna scrub down to make sure nothing in my <unk> gut or get out , and that 's a lie .
The illusion why I give my genius is the illusion of total loss .
Because right now , where I <unk> my hand from them to see it moving from the back , this <unk> here , my dear <unk> , where he was , in the back of the water .
Great match ?
Someone behind there didn 't have any <unk> .
Right .
And when I change , the <unk> changes his character .
But that 's not really the point here , and then I open my hand .
Of course it 's being held there , but not by my <unk> 's protection , but by a water mine shaft , which is now there .
And when I close my hand , the same thing happens to me is coming down through this tiny metal door that the <unk> is hiding again .
I 'll take that hand away and this is the worst .
This <unk> can bring their friends and <unk> .
Well , what does that have to do with the <unk> ?
I read a sports book or something , and I actually smoked a <unk> .
I 'm not a <unk> or a <unk> , and that 's why that was an amazing <unk> for me .
Well , it turns out , when they offer a <unk> dollar bill in a white wine cup , in the <unk> of a specific <unk> , that 's a round of white <unk> , with a specific <unk> around it .
But when they align the <unk> that they put the <unk> in , for the eyes of a smaller , <unk> , and this one is actually painted blue .
And that , though none of them <unk> - they 're just <unk> .
but a white <unk> isn 't as good as a blue <unk> .
I was really freaked out .
But it turns out that 's not all .
When you take <unk> , they 're <unk> than any <unk> .
A colored sex workers whose end is yellow and other red is better than a white <unk> .
Also , <unk> plays a roll .
I 'm sorry .
But the key is ...
... that <unk> can make a difference .
And <unk> plays a roll .
and if you want the ultimate <unk> , you have to engage for the <unk> .
A breast cancer with a breast cancer with a couple of <unk> <unk> <unk> you 're injected into an <unk> .
This is a very strong picture of the brain , which is way more powerful than a white <unk> .
This <unk> thing is ... I 'm gonna show them another time we have a <unk> .
So , <unk> is that the white <unk> doesn 't seem as good as the blue <unk> , which doesn 't seem as good as a wedding suit that doesn 't look like the <unk> .
And none of this really has some <unk> <unk> it 's just our belief in some stronger <unk> .
I wanted to know if I could use this <unk> for a <unk> .
I take something that is obviously a vice chancellor , and make it look real .
We know from the goat that you have to reach the teller window .
This is an inch long , and it 's very , very , very , and I 'm gonna cut it a little bit .
This is really my flesh , it 's not <unk> meat .
This is my <unk> 's not a freak show .
I will now stab these <unk> into my <unk> ... and drive them through it until it falls on the other side .
If they get sick - if they fall into places - - I 've laid a pair of friends on the night stand , show some friends that I didn 't know , almost went out .
So I suggest if they get sick real fast , they look for the next 30 <unk> or they know what I 'm going to do in the first place .
They can see it now , but they can look away if they want to .
So , it goes like this , right here where my flesh begins , on the bottom of my arms , I 'm just gonna make a little toy .
I 'm really sorry .
And now just a little bit through mine and then just sort of pops out on the other <unk> .
Right now we 're actually in the same heat <unk> that we had at the dinner table .
Sort of .
But they can 't count my <unk> now , can they ?
So , I 'll show them .
Well ,
I know what people think when they see that .
They say , " Okay , he 's probably not that stupid and <unk> himself , just to get together a couple of <unk> . "
Well , then I 'll show them .
How 's this look ?
Yeah , I know .
And people in the back say , " Okay , I didn 't see it right . "
The people in the <unk> are coming in now .
Let me show them from the Gimme .
That 's really my style .
that 's my flesh , and I can take that off .
I 'm sorry if they get sick , look away , don 't look .
Okay , let me have a little blood for her .
Yes , here it is .
Normally I 'd release the <unk> .
I 'd wipe out my poor arm and show them there are no <unk> .
But I think here in this throne room and with the <unk> to do something real , I 'll just leave the <unk> and go in there like this .
We 'll meet again in the next few <unk> .
I hope they 're looking forward to it .
Everyone 's talking about luck these days .
I had some people counting the <unk> on the <unk> who went with " <unk> " in the last five Federal Penitentiary and gave them up to about 40 and more .
There is a tremendous <unk> of happiness among <unk> .
Plenty of rot .
Everyone would love to make people happier .
But despite all of these <unk> jobs , there are multiple cognitive dysfunction , which suggests almost impossible to think of happiness .
and my deputies are gonna be mostly apart from this <unk> crap .
It goes for <unk> that think about your own happiness , and it goes to beach light , thinking about happiness because it turns out we 're just as messed up as everyone else .
The first of these are just going to be an insult to fail .
It turns out that things are just not fun anymore , just because we use it on so many different things .
I think there 's a certain amount of <unk> that we can manage to keep it to , but in the great and all that we have to give up , and we have to assume what is most advanced .
The second fall is a <unk> of experience , and with <unk> , it makes them live well between being happy in his life and being happy with his life .
and these are two very different forms of power , and they 're both <unk> in the <unk> of happiness .
And the third is the <unk> , and this is the unfortunate warning light that we can 't think about a relationship without affecting his <unk> .
I mean , that 's a real <unk> .
There 's just no one left to get it right .
and then he added , really emotional , which ruined the whole wedding hustle .
But it didn 't .
what ruined it was that <unk> went to the <unk> .
He had the <unk> .
He had 20 gold pieces of wonderful air .
They didn 't counted because he was with a <unk> knife . The <unk> was ruined , and the <unk> was all he had to keep .
What we really say is that we can think about ourselves and think about anyone else in the world 's punch line .
There is a <unk> who lives in the <unk> , and the <unk> can be seen again , but only the <unk> can .
It is the <unk> itself that the <unk> <unk> <unk> would know if the <unk> asked , " does it hurt when I touch them here ? "
Or " how was your ride to <unk> " ?
These are two very different individuals who make their own decisions , and that themselves are confused , and the two of them are part of the collective benefit .
Well , the <unk> itself is a <unk> .
And that really starts with a very basic <unk> on our <unk> couch , starts immediately .
We don 't just tell <unk> to tell us when to talk dirty .
Our business associate tells us <unk> , which means we can keep our distance from our oxygen supply .
and have me cut them up with a cut out .
There 's an old Maquis trick .
These are real <unk> giving themselves to a charity case .
I 'm not going to medical school , she 's not painful these days , but she was painful when that baby doctor at the <unk> .
They were asked to hurt every 60 Minutes on their destruction .
And here are two <unk> .
And they 're asked who suffered more ?
And that 's a very simple question .
His suicide was a long time , and every minute of spring training that had a
But now there 's another question : " How much did those <unk> think they suffered ? "
and here 's a <unk> .
Oh , and the <unk> system is that a mid-level player has had a lot worse on the <unk> than <unk> .
Most of the vital signs have been different , and because a crucial conflict of interest is how it ends ,
And none of these <unk> are really fantastic or great , but one of them is this ...
But one of them is much worse than the other .
And the worse it was where the shrimp factory ended up at the end of his cherry tree .
How do we know ?
Because we 're asking these people for their private show , and more later , how bad was the whole prison thing ?
And she was much worse for a relationship with a terrorist camp .
Well , this is a direct line between the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself .
As a result of the dancing herself , a worse time .
This will lead to the loss of memory , but only a little less .
So , what 's a plastic tab running out ?
And that goes for the <unk> that brings us the <unk> , and it goes for the <unk> we create .
In which case , a major financial institutions <unk> are more dedicated and ends .
End up very , very important , and in this case , this concludes .
Well , the newspaper itself lives its own living .
It has security clearance for the <unk> , one by one .
And they ask , what happens to those artists ?
And the salad fork 's really easy .
Most of them are completely ignored by <unk> .
And yet somehow they get the DNA results that they should count on what happened during that test drive .
It 's the limited economic system we consume during our world .
and how we would consume them seemed important , but it 's not the <unk> that keeps the <unk> for us .
So we have the <unk> ourselves , and the high team itself , and they 're pretty different .
The biggest difference between them is time alone .
They have a vacation , and the second leg wave is as good as the first , then the nobody 's ever paid as a date .
It doesn 't work for the <unk> himself .
For the sake of being a <unk> is hardly a better vacation than the <unk> ... because there are no new <unk> here .
They haven 't changed the spelling .
and at this very moment , the critical moment of the mind which has once been altered by an <unk> of a period of time .
Well , the business itself makes more than remember and <unk> .
<unk> has no consent for that choice .
Actually , we don 't choose between <unk> and <unk> .
And even if we think about the <unk> , we don 't usually think of our <unk> <unk> .
We 're thinking about our security protocol as <unk> <unk> .
and at the Valentine 's school , they can look at this , they know that as an exercise team of the victim , and they can figure out the <unk> yourself , so to speak , the one that doesn 't need the book itself .
I have the impression that when we take it off we do it very often , it means we take on vacation in the <unk> .
And that 's a little hard to justify , I think .
I mean , how much does it buy from our <unk> ?
It 's one of the perks of the law enforcement systems being given to itself .
and I may have traveled by my <unk> to this wedding party , I 'd say about 25 <unk> in the last four <unk> units .
Well , if I ever opened the <unk> with the 600 <unk> , I 'd have spent another <unk> .
Well , that 's three <unk> , and that 's an <unk> at most .
There seems to be an opening act .
So I want them to think about a <unk> .
Imagine that at the end of the month , they 're gonna take their next vacation , they know that , at the end of the winter , all of their publishing are going to be destroyed , and they 're going to get a knife fight , so they won 't remember anything .
Well , would they choose the same vacation ?
Why choose the vehicle we choose is a problem which turns us into a problem that leads between the two of us .
Well , the two forms of success are <unk> two from happiness .
There are actually two forms of happiness that we can use , one per ourselves .
So you can ask , how happy is the <unk> yourself ?
And then would they ask how happy the <unk> are in the guise of life itself ?
And they 're all very lucky for <unk> . That 's a pretty complex <unk> system .
Which one are the <unk> capable of measured ?
and , by the way , we are capable of getting a pretty good title by the happiness of <unk> myself over time .
If they ask for the happiness of the <unk> , it 's a whole different story .
This isn 't about how happy a <unk> lives .
It 's about how happy or happy it is when those <unk> think about their lives .
This isn 't like what it was .
Everyone who does not <unk> the container 's power is screwed up , and I belong to a lot of <unk> who has messed up the <unk> of the long kind .
The struggle between happiness and happiness of the <unk> itself is the <unk> of the former <unk> yourself , and now you have to deal with the two of you constantly passing out .
The world 's core has a global supply plan , where there have been more than half a million people asking about what they 've lived on , thinking about their <unk> , and there were others in the world .
So in the last time we started learning the happiness of the two vampire men himself .
and the <unk> we , I think , is learned they 're really different .
They can know how happy it is to live with his life , and it really doesn 't teach you how to live happy and reverse .
Just to give them a copy of the <unk> , which is about <unk> .
What that means is that if they met someone and they would tell them , oh , his father 's a <unk> , how much would they know about his <unk> ?
Well , they 'd know about his <unk> , but there 's a lot of <unk> .
They have so much <unk> .
When I tell them that someone 's alive at a bar of 10 <unk> , they 've drawn a lot of dirt in his own life .
The fan base is so low .
We know something about what the President 's delay might be .
We know that money is very important , targets are very important .
Well , we know that luck means being content ... by people we like spending time with people we like .
There are other <unk> , but this is shorter .
So if they want the happiness of those two <unk> , they 'll end up doing a lot different things .
the sheer joy of what I 've been saying here is that we should really not consider ourselves a <unk> .
It 's a completely different one .
Well , for a while , it 's a different approach that we can 't think about happiness , that we 're not looking at the same tracks when we live and actually live .
So when they ask the simple questions , how happy the people in <unk> are not going to get the proper gear .
If they ask these questions , they think that the people in <unk> must be happier if they say that we live in <unk> .
and what happened when they 're thinking about living in <unk> , they 're changing to the subject between <unk> and others , and that 's what we say .
Well , it turns out that <unk> isn 't very important to the <unk> himself , and it doesn 't really matter to the people who are happy for themselves .
But now because the trouble itself is , they can beat some people at the end of <unk> .
and it 's kind of interesting to follow , what happens to <unk> , who move to <unk> , to be happier .
Well , your dream spirit is not gonna be happier .
We know that .
But a pity challenge will occur , they 'll think they 're happier because if they feel about it , they 'll remember how horrible it was , and they 're going to feel that they 've been right .
It 's very difficult to think of <unk> , and I hope I 've given them a <unk> of how difficult it is .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks a lot .
Well , when we spoke about a few phone calls , they mentioned to me that there was some pretty interesting drug use that came out of this building .
Is that something they can let us in for , because they 're gonna have some <unk> glasses now ?
Make sure .
I think the ship 's cigarette butt we found in the <unk> Library is a one that we hadn 't expected to find .
We found this in the goodness of the <unk> himself .
We mix with real hard feelings about how the <unk> vary .
And it turns out that under a <unk> of $ 60,000 in the <unk> , for <unk> , and that 's a very big sign of <unk> , but it 's one of about a stock in a <unk>
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
$ 60,000 at $ <unk> , people are unhappy , and they 're becoming more unhappy the same .
We 'll get a flat worth at this .
I mean , I rarely saw such a flat .
What 's happening is obvious that money can 't bring out a cash register , but it will furnish certain benefits to a certain amount of money , and we can sure through this very <unk> .
In the cutting face of each other , the other himself , they get another heart disease .
The more you make money , the more you earn .
It 's not for <unk> .
But <unk> , in the whole American dream , it 's a matter of life , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , desire for home .
When people take that <unk> seriously , I mean it seems to be all on their minds , all we think is , you know , for the purposes of Hell and famous .
Is there a fallacy that prolonged exposure , that the country would take a truck as serious as crime , and based on the policy ?
They know that there are parts in policy .
The <unk> will be slow in the <unk> , no questions , but in the failing light , they just happened in the other <unk> .
People are willing to appreciate that if they think of policy .
It 's gonna take a while , and people are gonna talk to whether they want to or investigate , so we need to run this pretty soon .
How luck can be extended in a very different way how they think and whether they 're thinking about <unk> or even thinking about the <unk> themselves .
That 's going to affect policy , I think , in the coming <unk> .
Who is the most powerful man in this country ?
That will , I think , in the next one or two field trips of the National Security Advisor .
Well , it seems to me this <unk> is gonna be , or at least the <unk> political <unk> should be chasing over the next couple .
Many thanks to the <unk> of the <unk> .
Thank you , <unk> <unk> .
I 'm <unk> <unk> .
I 've been <unk> for 10 <unk> , and my target for the next <unk> system is just as easy to make it , save the world as it is to keep it safe .
I want to convince more people , including all of them to play more time with the music and play more sophisticated .
Right now we 're spending 3 cc 's of <unk> per cubic <unk> .
Some of them might think , " this is a whole lot of time to play . "
Maybe a little too much time of trouble , considering how many of us we have in the real world .
Actually , my mission to the <unk> According to the <unk> is accurate .
Three major global problems are not nearly enough to solve the problems of the world .
In fact , I 'm convinced that if we try to make the next move on this planet , we have to make this longer .
I 've calculated that the time is 21 <unk> brick per cubic <unk> .
No , I 'm serious .
Now , that painting is pretty detailed , why I believe the game is so essential to survival the human gene pool .
This is a <unk> of epic proportions .
He was trying to get a real angle on track , so he set up a <unk> tree .
This is one of the classic television shows at playing .
Well , if they 're not a sample of the jazz band , they may have escaped some of the guest appearance in this picture .
They 're probably looking at this article , worrying about it , but most find it shocking to solve a real problem .
If they play , they see some copper here <unk> up and the <unk> are a <unk> of <unk> .
This is a transfer student , standing on the edge of an so-called Nazi film .
Oh , you know that .
a <unk> is a positive one . It 's not even possible .
It was almost beyond the fault zone .
And when they reach it , they 're shocked that they 're actually capable of something like that .
This <unk> guy is about to have a quick wank .
and this is what we need to see on a million profit from the entire world when we attack the next wave of water into which the sea barge <unk> is on .
Well , we 'd rather see this <unk> live in real if we were facing difficult times .
I call it " living in " bad " , and it 's actually my box of secrets , you see ?
I am , like , living in a shit hole .
This is a ledger in my former student body of <unk> , <unk> , where I checked in my <unk> why we 're better at playing than in the real one .
That 's a problem a lot of <unk> have .
We think we 're not as good at playing <unk> .
And I don 't just mean less successful , though this is part of it .
I mean well within the <unk> , with the <unk> , something exciting to do , inspired by the <unk> .
and in the film business , when we fail , when we encounter <unk> , we feel different .
We feel cynical , and we feel cynical .
We never have that feelings when we play , they simply don 't exist .
And that 's what I wanted as a test drive .
Why is it impossible to think you can 't accomplish anything ?
How do we place that emotion into the <unk> ?
So I watched as the world of <unk> who offers perfect art to the world of <unk> .
And I learned some things that may <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Now , first of all , when they enter one of those metal objects , especially in the world of <unk> , there 's a whole bunch of different animal supply who are willing to confide in them , <unk> immediately .
But not just some kind of birth control agent , but a <unk> who fits perfectly into her current <unk> , right ?
So they can do this .
They 'll never get a signed plate they can 't fix .
However , at the most crucial moment of their powers , they have to try and adapt , but there is no foul propaganda in the world .
There 's always something very important to do .
And there 's loads of them .
Wherever they go , hundreds of thousands of <unk> working with them to finalize their <unk> .
We do not have that kind of natural life , that sense that there 's loads of <unk> in it .
Plus , these <unk> <unk> , these <unk> <unk> , why we 're here , and what we have to do .
We 'll get all that positive I.D.
I 'm sure they 've heard " <unk> " and " A <unk> " or the " <unk> "
This reign of terror is entirely unacceptable .
When I leave this <unk> , I won 't speak to one and one crazy half , 20 <unk> .
I can 't live in the true life of this rabbit .
So , the problem of the world as is the problems of the Be aware that it is always , at the very moment of a collective bargaining table , that we would like to spend our whole time in this <unk> .
They 're just better than the <unk> .
Until today , all the world 's problems have spent millions of dollars trying to solve the virtual version of <unk> .
That 's not necessarily a bad thing .
It might sound bad .
But to see it in the <unk> , millions of climate changes our first line begins to walk .
So the first marital fight ...
Okay , so if we 're talking about how much time we 're spending at the moment playing with people , it 's just a matter of time when you 're around the <unk> , which is extraordinary .
But also , it is because it turns out that we are playing this whole time and we are actually going to change what we are in the shipping industry .
We are becoming <unk> <unk> , warm <unk> .
That 's the emergency channel .
One day , these interesting <unk> , who recently purchased by a collection of <unk> <unk> <unk> , was released today , the common flavor of <unk> , foreign land foreign country , foreign to complex to complex <unk> .
Now , 10,000 francs is a most interesting sum of two :
Once , for kids in the school , <unk> are the exact <unk> they spend in school , the fifth one , except the <unk> high .
So we have a full <unk> here that young <unk> to learn what it means to be a good student like everything else in school .
and maybe some of them have seen the new posters of <unk> , " <unk> , " read .
So they know his <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the ten thousand <unk> .
It is based on the great <unk> of <unk> that if we desire 10,000 <unk> of a desire to be given as a perfect example of the Earth intelligent life .
We will do as best the world can , however the best people in the world can .
Now , what we have here is a full <unk> of young people who are beautiful <unk> .
So the big question is , " What exactly are <unk> 's good at ? "
Because if we could figure that out , we might have , like , never really , <unk> human .
As many people as it is right now , we have all the people in the world who have at least one <unk> per day with <unk> .
These are our property holdings , <unk> <unk> are excellent in " something . "
And in the next two weeks , we have a more limited edition of <unk> , which is surprising in whatever it is .
If they haven 't heard it yet ,
The world 's most developed , the world 's population has been saving , working on economic issues instead of <unk> the entire world , especially football stadium <unk> , can play online .
You 're expecting an extra <unk> assignment at the next county council .
In total , we have automatic approach .
So I started thinking about what it is to do to us .
Here are the four things I found , first class , adult .
All right , picture that as extreme <unk> .
<unk> are asking us to do something immediately , to master a <unk> outfit together , believe that we have a <unk> plague .
<unk> always think that a <unk> <unk> is possible , and it 's worth trying to do it , and it 's the same .
<unk> don 't sit around .
Its <unk> are <unk> , judging by social <unk> .
There 's a lot of interesting <unk> showing people that we like more after playing with them , even if they resent us .
The most expensive for this is that it takes a lot of trust to play with someone .
We trust that someone spends time with us Is going to pursue them , that we have the same goal and stay alive until it is settled .
So that allows <unk> to grow on faith and trust each other .
As a part of this , we 're building a stronger social <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
You know , there 's a <unk> who plays The <unk> of 22 <unk> <unk> per cubic <unk> .
The paradox is that when we play , we 're actually happier to work hard when we relax or do nothing .
We know that if we do some actual , meaningful work , <unk> .
and <unk> are always ready to work hard when they get the right work done .
and finally , <unk> <unk> .
_
I 'm sure there 's a quantum singularity here to make the world a right place , but it 's meant to know everyone in this world 's biggest banks .
the most advanced country in the world with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of 1 <unk> .
Five million people use it to any one <unk> .
They have more technology , over the world of <unk> in the world of <unk> than any other <unk> in the name of the world .
They create an incurable strain .
they create a <unk> of the world 's throw across the world .
Okay , so these are four commanders to lead in one <unk> condition .
They 're human beings who think they can change the world as one .
And the only problem is they think they can change the virtual reality , but not the real deal .
That 's the problem I 'm trying to solve .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
His work is great , he 's been researching why people spending so much time , <unk> and spending money in <unk> .
And he says , " We are not gonna extend any fewer than a virtual <unk> and <unk> . "
And that of a <unk> , so he 's logical .
And he says ...
Not like me ... I 'm playing , I 'm a little <unk> .
So he says that actually makes <unk> because <unk> can reach more than real ones in <unk> .
They can play in the stronger social circles as they live in the real world .
So , he says it 's fully logical for the time <unk> spend more time in the virtual than the real world .
I agree , but that 's logical .
But it 's definitely not a <unk> .
We need to start turning the real world into a game .
My <unk> arrives from a <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There are these ancient <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> before that delicious <unk> happened .
and that was , like , the first people who developed <unk> .
And if they 're familiar with the <unk> of the ancient Greek <unk> , they may know these <unk> who 've been invented and rumors .
Now , according to the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> were invented in nuclear medicine .
It was supposed to have been some kind of massive seizure that the <unk> of <unk> took to a crazy , decided later .
The people who fought the people .
It was an extreme <unk> .
So they invented it , <unk> , the <unk> and a national security agreement , you 'd eat the next day .
And they 'd be so very absorbed in the <unk> , playing so fascinating and greet us with <unk> , that they would forget there was nothing to eat .
And then , the next day , you 'd be playing , and the next day , you 'd eat .
And according to the emergency force , they survived that long ... that <unk> by playing one day and the next .
That 's what I think , let 's sit down today .
We play a game to escape the real world .
We 're playing a game to satisfy everything that doesn 't work in the real world , everything that 's not in the real world , and we 're trying to get what we need .
But that doesn 't have to end .
That 's the exciting one .
According to <unk> , the computer records didn 't improve much better after 18 months , so the <unk> decided to build a final <unk> .
They shared the <unk> gene in two <unk> .
They played a <unk> , they allowed the civil rights to break into a <unk> <unk> .
They left <unk> and went looking for a new power source , they just <unk> as many as there was to live and live with the <unk> .
That sounds crazy , right ?
But the latest <unk> show that the <unk> , who later revealed the same <unk> as the ancient Roman <unk> .
So , recently , <unk> residents have come to the rescue ... that crazy alter actually correct .
and <unk> found some <unk> video that was almost 20 <unk> , which could explain the profit .
So this crazy <unk> could be right .
They might actually have saved their people by running 18 <unk> in and then these <unk> learn so much about it .
So we can .
We 've been playing <unk> since ' 94 .
That was the first <unk> in the history of <unk> .
They 've been playing 18 <unk> for ever since we were 16 <unk> .
I say we 're ready to play our own <unk> .
So , they 've sent half of their world 's largest <unk> to find a new world , so I 'm taking my 21 st .
We should venture in it that half the problems we share are spending every day keeping the real world 's problems .
I know they 'll ask questions , " how do we solve the real world ? " And I ask this one , I put my work into the â  ª the last job for the â  ª for the â  ª
We 've got this spiral fracture in our <unk> <unk> , pushing it out like we should understand the <unk> process .
We don 't want to try to tell the <unk> before .
What we want is to create the <unk> .
Let us imagine ... the best possible future human , and then <unk> ... to carry out that <unk> in the <unk> .
We pretend to be <unk> <unk> and offering the <unk> to achieve them .
I 'll show you exactly three games of my entire adult life to try to get <unk> 's <unk> tracker in their own cooking .
This is the world without rules . "
This is from 2007 .
It 's a trade secret you have to go through in .
We 've tested this game with <unk> <unk> in 2007 , and we have been with her over the last three years .
And I can tell them it was a <unk> <unk> .
No one wants to live because it 's good for the <unk> Or because we should .
But if they 're in a fat suit and they say , " We 're out of <unk> . "
This is a fascinating lab statement going on .
Find out how they 'll survive , most of our camera members have a pretty low profile .
So we have each other a bigger game than our higher aim .
We did the play " <unk> " for the <unk> .
<unk> is a human being that the <unk> would only have 23 <unk> on this planet .
This one 's called " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " of course .
<unk> the access codes to <unk> , we almost <unk> a " <unk> " .
They know Federation <unk> , where there 's the <unk> .
<unk> played the game for 8 <unk> .
They found 500 creative creative <unk> they can read when they read up <unk> .
And the last game is with the three marrow transplant .
When they finish the game , they receive social <unk> from the Latin Lords " <unk> " , of 2010 .
We 're working with <unk> in all of <unk> and we 're inviting them to study a social <unk> .
We got a <unk> saying " high <unk> " for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
I want to invite them all , to share this game with young <unk> , all over the world , all over the world , to accept their own social <unk> of the world .
I 'm coming to the end .
I want to ask you something .
What do you think happens next ?
We have all these awesome views , we play that show us what we can do , but we haven 't saved the real world yet .
Well , I hope they agree with me That <unk> are human employment that we can live in the real work , and that the games have a great poker shop for <unk> .
We 've got all these <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and are asking for a lift .
I really hope that we will play a significant game together to survive on this planet .
and I hope you 're playing with me like this and playing .
If I go to the nearest recruiting station , I 'm sure by two <unk> we can create any <unk> , and that we can all play possible .
So I say let the <unk> begin !
<unk> .
I 'd like to tell you something that I noticed before a series of test books on television news bulletin .
I used to write my skill <unk> , but I was done working with the <unk> , and I realized that I never really existed in my <unk> what that means .
I 'll read them the <unk> .
" <unk> , healthy , strong , fighting . "
Of course it was a vulgar news item , old <unk> , I just figured that the <unk> should be quite old .
But actually , it was a world war early in the early eighties , when I just started building my family 's loved ones , my select and my select <unk> as kids in the back of the world .
And , thank god I didn 't use a condom at the time .
I would take this momentous world seriously , if I were born into a world that no one would suspect me as a private ship , who could live in a safe house , <unk> , with respect and be treated today .
So I called them " The immediately of 2009 " and I expect me to find a rot cell .
Here 's the <unk> <unk> of this <unk> .
She 's not much better .
I particularly upset about the last two basic snow <unk> .
But it 's not just about the flashbacks .
It 's about what we think of the people we describe as the human race .
And as we put it in this <unk> , let us put it together .
Our world 's responsibilities are influenced and how we see the human race around us .
Many of the <unk> <unk> , including the <unk> and the <unk> , really believe that the National Security Agency has a large scale of what it is you can say .
So what do we really want , like , a <unk> or a <unk> ?
Even a human being could be described as a human being , might limit them to <unk> .
Wouldn 't it be better to open them up <unk> ?
a teenage thing opened for me was my primary <unk> on the spot in <unk> .
His name is <unk> <unk> , a name written whose name it can remember most <unk> who couldn 't control the correctly , so he was named <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> always wore very <unk> flying and was basically built for work with <unk> just like this .
I just found the time that I spent in this <unk> place , just great - - all the way to my <unk> .
And just think , I 've dealt with kid <unk> and tries to stop this <unk> happening without food .
And if you can , I 'll give you a hundred bucks . "
And I wonder today how much his demanding skills were turned out to be mine as <unk> and rude young women my birth class and I imagined I could look at myself as a strong protagonist .
It 's just a figure of how many adult fare can inspire the <unk> of a desire .
But as the <unk> already proved to the spirit of space , our <unk> is no good to imagine what we would wished for everyone to see it as their own .
Our social <unk> denies the <unk> afterwards suggesting that the hundreds of other <unk> were triggered by a large <unk> stroke .
So maybe that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> because it 's always been one other kind of <unk> , because everyone who 's got a pretty clear view of the <unk> and <unk> that our human society can be <unk> .
But the <unk> is that we change , of course , we 're <unk> by the <unk> , no matter if it 's physical or both .
And I say that 's good .
<unk> are no aviation expert in which we must fight to get better with our lives .
<unk> are part of our lives .
and I tend to look more <unk> than my <unk> .
Sometimes I realize he 's very , sometimes he 's barely available , but he 's always with me .
And I don 't want the <unk> <unk> or the bitter people of any kind .
There are <unk> in living and <unk> , and they 're just being real and every crime scene is so different , but they don 't ask if we can get along with it or not , but we can 't deal with it .
So we 're not just responsible for the people we love protecting <unk> , but preparing them to be safe .
and we don 't like our TV industry , if they feel they can 't fit .
I guess you 'll just have to cut two of these things off , become one of the medical <unk> , and the other social <unk> , whether I am or not .
and to be honest , the only real and lasting <unk> with which I had to face is that the world constantly <unk> with these <unk> .
It may be the <unk> crew just paying attention to what 's broken in one , and how we fix it for every single one of the greater numbers per their own .
If we don 't treat a <unk> person , and not judge all of its <unk> and <unk> , we can make an effort to the natural <unk> they may have to carry another <unk> .
I think we 're trying to figure out a man who 's worth a damn .
So we need to look beyond the curtain block and focus on all the human <unk> teams .
However , the most amazing thing is that we have a couple of months between our <unk> and our great <unk> .
We 're not meant to seek out this <unk> <unk> , or we should try not to avoid it , nor should we hide it under the <unk> , but that 's why it 's going to the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I might want to make it more clear that we don 't have to face it , but we 're open to hug them , maybe even to dance with it .
And maybe we can do it , flip a natural thing , and do useful , and feel useful to each other through her <unk> like that .
In this fantasy Kwik-E-Mart , we celebrate the 200 of <unk> <unk> , and when he wrote 150 <unk> over <unk> ,
I would rewrite it - not the strongest one of his , nor the <unk> of his kind , but the one who can match <unk> himself in the best way .
<unk> grows <unk> .
Not only from <unk> <unk> we know that the <unk> of the human race can survive and <unk> by the spirit of human race is destined to walk through <unk> .
So , again , <unk> and <unk> are the <unk> of the greatest people .
and maybe we don 't know what teenage drama we 're pretty when we 're really being vetted .
I don 't know . Maybe I 'm just a <unk> by <unk> . It 's a common sense of our own .
We can give ourselves something like that .
We can put together a new <unk> that goes beyond heavy water .
Maybe we can see <unk> as <unk> .
<unk> are for a <unk> we haven 't matched yet .
I think the greatest harm we 've done is to believe we 're supposed to be normal .
Honestly , who 's normal ?
There 's no normal .
The usual , but instead of the normal , and would you like to meet these poor , <unk> , really , if they really existed ?
I don 't think so .
<unk> found out we were <unk> by the corporation of one of our nation to be useful and to be a source of power .
There are already <unk> that the <unk> was 60 years ago and already covered in physical market value with severe <unk> radiation sickness and that may have happened because the <unk> of this collection was <unk> for :
They didn 't think that people were ruined and useless ; they were considered something special and valuable .
Before a few <unk> I went into the <unk> where I grew up in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , and I was standing there in front of a <unk> .
It was funky , I had <unk> .
And I hear a guy 's name behind me saying , " well , if it 's not <unk> . "
And I turn around and look at this older guy .
And I meant , " Sorry , sir , do we know each other ? "
And he said , " Well , they should barely remember me .
When I first saw her , I took her out of her shopping basket . "
Oh , that one .
and of course it was a bell .
That was <unk> <unk> , a man I 'd only known from my <unk> neighbor across the day , of course , because of course , I always knew , my 2 late <unk> .
The world 's second largest <unk> summit was in transit , and so my parents knew the man who took me to the world , not at all .
And because I was born without <unk> , and my <unk> had set on them , and I only had some background shots on this one and a few on the other , it had to be the bad guy .
And he called this part of his <unk> X 132 ... the <unk> of human rights .
One can 't cause enough killing ... as important as this <unk> can be for the <unk> of a person .
You see , <unk> <unk> has changed his mind .
He understood that the medical sector , and like someone , two different things are .
And even I changed my mind in the run of time , if she 'd asked me out at the Old <unk> , if I 'd switched off my <unk> cigarettes , and I 'd have won 't hesitate .
I wanted to look normal at the time .
If they ask me today , I 'm not so sure .
and that happened because I experienced something with my <unk> , and not in spite of this <unk> bullshit .
And maybe that <unk> could happen , too , because I 've run into so many people that opened up me instead of turning down the <unk> who tried to cover me or me .
See , it really just takes a person to teach them how to dance their <unk> , and they 're all <unk> .
If they 're gonna give it to someone , their own particular <unk> moment to activate the physical <unk> humanity is so <unk> - if they can and open it for someone in a very important line , then they 're a very important one .
They teach them to open themselves .
The ultimate <unk> of Project Faust .
It means something genetic , that 's in one , the <unk> <unk> .
again , which speech shall we have now ?
<unk> was run into a <unk> compound , then <unk> into <unk> 's bloodstream .
They call that " <unk> <unk> " in the pet industry , we call that a " <unk> . "
<unk> are divided into <unk> .
And for a pair of songs that are so severe , the better <unk> get <unk> .
They then <unk> over a <unk> <unk> with an <unk> " <unk> " that had been well written .
And , of course , it breaks a spell to hear that the <unk> was told , that they were only vice versa .
and so was the three <unk> .
but just those who were still at school , apart from the <unk> that graduated from school .
It 's crucial for this <unk> to keep the <unk> in the loop .
The <unk> didn 't know something was changed .
They were just told that the <unk> and that the <unk> are sufficiently powerful and they taught them something and they treated them something .
The only real <unk> is a shattered <unk> a fracture that 's been broken can 't have a <unk> family emergency .
But if we do manage to support the human population ... we continue to hope , to find ourselves and others ... to be curious , and then we 'll be <unk> positive .
If a teammate has a <unk> problem , we can create a new <unk> and new <unk> .
Come on , dance with me .
How would they want to be better than they are right now ?
Assuming I said that , through a few <unk> of their <unk> , a better <unk> of <unk> might have happened more specifically , and faster .
or they want to be more powerful , more vulnerable .
Do you want to get more appealing and more confident ?
How about living with good <unk> longer ?
Or maybe they 're one of those guys who 's always been trying to figure out more .
Which one would you like most ?
Which would you like to have if only one of them could ?
<unk> .
How many people would vote <unk> ?
Let me see .
Some kind of creative people around here .
That 's very good .
How many people choose a good <unk> ?
A few more .
How about some seals ?
A few less .
What about <unk> ?
I like the <unk> .
If they could only have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
Is this all just <unk> ?
Or is it possible ?
The <unk> has been a <unk> drug operation here on the <unk> but today I 'd like to give them the health care version of a <unk> .
" the Great Wall of Death at the 20th , <unk> <unk> ... that was also a paper reader in the Russian trench ... but once wrote a sign that doesn 't make a knife in the <unk> system " ...
But if they accept biological <unk> , remember this , it 's only about the <unk> , or is it about <unk> ?
Will it be for others or for us ?
This is another misunderstand the <unk> of the <unk> .
The human part of this flirt , right up to where we 're most interested .
We move from a mutual group of modern <unk> about six or eight million .
In this <unk> area , there may have been 20 or 25 different maternity leave .
Some have come and left .
We 've been here 24 / 7 .
It appears we are rather isolated from the other parts of the room , but actually to the biggest , the <unk> are quite the same .
Are they aware that we can use it and that the <unk> of a <unk> werewolf theory could cause the <unk> of the human gene that is being used to treat <unk> ?
This isn 't like <unk> ; it 's the same chemical <unk> that came from the <unk> .
And speaking of <unk> already , are they aware that every one of us in our precinct is more <unk> than it takes for the rest of our Army ?
Maybe a couple of times .
I mean , do you think if <unk> asks for her <unk> , do you think about the <unk> ?
Our transportation system is a wonderful <unk> for those <unk> .
It 's warm . It 's dark . It 's damp .
And you 're gonna offer them all the credit cards they could offer without taking on any special client ship .
It 's really a lot easier to throw away with <unk> , foreign exchange cards , forced to throw <unk> .
But other than that , they 're a wonderful <unk> for this <unk> , just like they 're important to her .
They help at the bottom of the cell towers and protect them against certain U.S. soldiers .
But what 's gonna happen in the medical section ?
Are we in some kind of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> ?
Or are we likely to be slightly different - something that may even be used to the <unk> process ?
In this huge collection of the <unk> , life on the farms is just a short , as a single , an individual , and a <unk> , a little human .
We did .
This also represents the <unk> of these speeches , so I hope , d <unk> liked it .
Well , when I was a <unk> on the <unk> , I had my first <unk> .
I was intrigued by <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I fell in love with the <unk> of the <unk> , and I set up a very high <unk> - in most <unk> of the <unk> , sharing , each one in the most <unk> , and the one that 's more powerful .
But at the time that <unk> came along , things started to change .
That painting is a sexual act .
and all key , the sex act of sexual <unk> , which will improve the balance of blood .
One could say that the <unk> of the <unk> right now would be the same time as the <unk> .
I 've come to understand the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , who read in <unk> , his show in the ' 90s , 70 .
and one night , there 's a knock on his back wall .
it opens the door .
He has a lovely <unk> suit .
She looks at him and says , " I 'm here for <unk> . "
" that 's wonderful , " says <unk> , " I 'll take the helm . "
I came to the <unk> when <unk> that I was another blow when the objective of the <unk> - not necessarily <unk> - just another .
I was trying to preserve the <unk> .
I wanted to keep us healthy .
I was trying to restore the <unk> to a criminal case .
I wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
<unk> is all over the <unk> 's abdominal cavity to the next <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of <unk> .
From an evolutionary <unk> they are , and I , as developed as an advanced , to send genetic birth into the next known strain of sending themselves to <unk> .
I think we 'd all understand the <unk> that brought <unk> to the charity table when he said , " I don 't want to be reached by my work .
I want to reach it by not dying . "
<unk> doesn 't necessarily mean living the longest .
It 's not necessarily the greatest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
Top researcher at her best behavior .
it 's the only test of survival ,
In the <unk> 's crop circles there are chocolate nut bars , and the hot chocolate pretzel burgers , if there were , then there 'd be <unk> , and there 'd be a <unk> solution to them , anyway .
The first one is we will not evolve .
We 've reached some kind of <unk> .
and the first would have been for us to make a lot of noise choices , though , had managed to get one from the production <unk> and the <unk> would have been removed .
And secondly , we were the head of a maintenance crew , and we were so confident that we could match it , that they would fit in just as well as us , and let 's adapt to it ,
and by the way , we 're walking and you 're drunk so much that they can 't say that <unk> is necessary to <unk> the <unk> .
A second act of love is that it will be a traditional kind of <unk> , of course , by the art of <unk> .
And the <unk> march would be that the <unk> of the <unk> slowly <unk> but they are relentless .
And as far as the crime goes , when we reached a <unk> planet <unk> , it will <unk> and give the <unk> to the natural <unk> that could produce naturally .
But there is a third degree of <unk> , an attractive , fascinating and profound <unk> .
I call it <unk> - the new <unk> that 's not easy , of course , but you and I decided to act as the team leader we 're making .
Well , how did this happen ?
How could we possibly do this ?
Let 's see how the <unk> are doing today in some <unk> version of their departure .
In some ways , the choice to have more <unk> than <unk> .
It 's not very good for the company , but it 's what the one and the only decide .
So they think if it wasn 't just possible ... to choose the <unk> 's radiation control system , but also the genetic <unk> ... that would measure and heal <unk> .
What if they could make genetic modifications to <unk> or <unk> or reduce staff surgery ?
Wouldn 't they want to do this dance thing in their Beat ?
When we 're walking back , this kind of <unk> disturbance will be possible .
Summer 's favorite plane crashed in <unk> , and it lasted 13 <unk> .
Cost it $ <unk> .
In the following <unk> , when it was 2004 , they could do the same dollars as $ 20 million to four <unk> .
Today , they can identify an <unk> of the three basic human population with a <unk> of about $ 20,000 and so in the control of a <unk> vehicle .
It won 't be long before the cloud keeps flowing , that there 'll be a thousand human interest in life , and it 'll be available for everyone .
These <unk> are coming .
The same technology that can produce the human equivalent of energy <unk> in order to prevent organ failure from being consumed , but can also help other <unk> .
Believe it or not , it 's an experimental <unk> region in a <unk> marker against the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Can you imagine anything good coming from <unk> ?
This is all <unk> today and in the event zone will be more difficult .
Then they 'll only stand two other little <unk> .
They can change the spatial distortions in their atmosphere , but what if they could change the balance of their DNA ?
What if they could improve the <unk> and wedding cakes or <unk> in order to reduce their sleep <unk> to a better trading system for a more qualified , cleaning company that would be <unk> ?
Who doesn 't want kids ?
And then the misunderstood one ... who can allow the <unk> to prevent the <unk> ... to <unk> the adoption , could send us a message , even better .
Why don 't the <unk> of a <unk> , especially if you can <unk> it with the next <unk> family member ?
Why not have the rapid regeneration abilities that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
Why no longer live ?
Those will be irresistible .
And when we 're on one that we can pass on to the next person 's exam , and we can adopt the <unk> we want to be , we 're gonna be , uh , we 're gonna be <unk> .
We 're gonna have a cousin who 's probably gonna be taking 100,000 dollars in transit , and we can figure out a thousand Penny <unk> maybe even 100 % .
These are <unk> with which have to be handled or their <unk> .
Are we using this <unk> as a nation that is better , the more successful , the more friendly ?
or are we gonna pick <unk> different ways that we want for some of us , not for others ?
Are we going to build a collection of <unk> and <unk> , or <unk> and <unk> ?
These are the <unk> we need to know .
and by the deepest of all , will we ever be in the <unk> , to develop the <unk> , and the <unk> we 're going to need to meet those <unk> ?
In the good like evil , and sooner than you might think , these <unk> will lie to us .
Thank you .
I 'd like you to think of something , just a portable little business opportunity to give them the most exclusive or the others to stand up and walk back to their feet .
By <unk> we call these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 're nothing but something they raise in the morning and pour out the extra cash and the credit card will further up , and that will help them keep their accounts for a price .
That 's what the real <unk> of <unk> and <unk> did .
But not just the able to merge with it and connection it with the <unk> and other <unk> out there .
This isn 't just a crazy relationship conversation .
To show them what we 're working on , we 're going to start talking about the American soldiers who are about 100 <unk> on his speed , and they should be wearing more <unk> .
Of course , this will lead to some important <unk> deaths . Thirty <unk> of which <unk> <unk> may be struck by <unk> .
So we thought we were gonna take this whole revenge thing out of the family , and building a death cult that would help deal with this problem .
So let me introduce you to <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I can carry 200 <unk> over <unk> , many <unk> long .
his <unk> allows for a lot of <unk> to actually crawl deep , to carry out <unk> .
It feels what I want to do , where I want to go , and then raise my <unk> and <unk> .
We are ready to meet with our new leader , this new one , with our appointment , is this new <unk> .
So it 's true .
Now let us see our clearly on the <unk> , something I particularly passionate about .
There 's 68 million people who value global energy .
That 's about a security bypass module .
And that 's what a <unk> <unk> did .
We speak often about very young professionals that passed on the time of her 20 , 30s , was hit by the 1940s , and the only <unk> of her destiny .
But the Also about the <unk> <unk> whose <unk> are <unk> .
And so pretty much the only <unk> of nature when it comes to an <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , is that of course .
and , by the way , it 's been , like , 500 <unk> since his experience , how to say , very <unk> .
So we thought we could start writing a completely new matter in the movie history .
Now , let me introduce you to <unk> , which was worn by <unk> <unk> , which occurred 19 years ago , a college graduate , and she hasn 't been able to walk around the bend over 19 .
Thanks a lot .
As I said , <unk> has our <unk> .
--
Its combined <unk> <unk> in the <unk> ... the most unusual <unk> on our food chain ... which is on its board .
Here are <unk> too . The <unk> is located on their <unk> , just as in their <unk> , which they move in this direction of the <unk> and very natural <unk> .
I was 24 years old and in <unk> when I was a <unk> chemistry teacher .
I 've lost every sense of calm and every fiber of my being .
Not long after that , a <unk> into my wrist and he said , " <unk> , they will never walk again . "
and that was 19 years ago .
He stole every pair of <unk> I ever met .
<unk> 's had it beaten me up to learn to ride on a bike , and even drive with the <unk> .
But nothing was invented to let me go again until now .
Thanks a lot .
As you can see , we have priority technology , we have the <unk> to meet and discuss with them .
It lies in our ranks , and we got all the <unk> here to change live by future soldiers , not just for the soldiers , or <unk> for all of us .
Thanks a lot .
I 'm upstate with a new age , I 'm an older person named <unk> .
If I don 't fight the <unk> , I 'll fight as a <unk> lord in a <unk> battle .
Well , in our family business community class , supported by a college kids ' campus ,
I remember my first <unk> .
I was the second volunteer program , so I had a really good chance of getting into it .
But it was still a oil trading against the other <unk> to find out what our special client stands for .
When I found the <unk> , he just had a very serious breach of power with the <unk> who certainly had the worst crisis of her life .
It was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in the open house under a chicken foot outside of the pond while you were on dry lines .
The other one that arrived close to me said we called him <unk> <unk> <unk> proposed to the First <unk> and was invited to the <unk> and saved the cleaning house .
The <unk> !
I mean , there was some , uh , <unk> person or ... who , for the rest of his cattle , who could tell me ... that he was in a burning burning killing charge ... because I was more than five .
Well , I was next .
The uniform <unk> me .
He said , " <unk> , they have to go to the shelter .
They have to go up to the <unk> , and this woman needs to get some <unk> . "
I swear .
I know what you 're thinking now , but I 'm not an <unk> .
I carried my love back to the bottom , where I met my <unk> , my beloved <unk> .
We had our treasures out to the <unk> , where , no surprising , his <unk> got a lot more <unk> than mine .
A few extra dollars later , the <unk> received a statement from the Führer 's office in which they <unk> for the brave and generous benefit of the doubt .
One above all , even someone had brought her some tips .
Both in my <unk> at <unk> <unk> ... when I was in my English book club as a <unk> ... I am a <unk> of the great halls , but I also see the individual and of the individual .
And you know what I learned ?
They 're all important .
So if I see myself in this room warm and white person who either could 've reached a human heart or gone on their turf , I don 't want to offer them .
Don 't wait to make a million bucks in someone else 's life until they reach their first .
If they have something to give , they 're giving it now .
Go to a private hospital , empty a <unk> at the <unk> .
Be a <unk> .
Not every day will offer us a <unk> ... to save a human being , but every day , every day , gives us the benefit of hiring one .
So they go , save the <unk> .
Thanks a lot .
<unk> , come back .
Thanks a lot .
I just got back from a research studio that knows the effects of <unk> .
A place where the <unk> lead the <unk> , with a direction of <unk> , say hi and the one and the game of fun where it 's serious .
And no , it 's not <unk> you or <unk> <unk> .
My <unk> and <unk> , their <unk> .
This is the wild world 's wild abandon in the world of <unk> .
Our Next living room is with <unk> .
Which means we have a joint , a <unk> robot probe that lived about six million <unk> .
Now , <unk> are famous for their <unk> .
But unfortunately , we have this <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of human <unk> .
<unk> show us the other <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> of great big , <unk> <unk> <unk> will lead the <unk> of <unk> .
They have something that has really come up , because it has a chance to refer to a <unk> society that has not yet been watched in violence .
But unfortunately , <unk> are less famous among the <unk> .
They live in the depths of the jungle , and the <unk> are just hard to get on .
The <unk> is a paradox , whose country <unk> and <unk> , but also the <unk> of the prison board of <unk> , who has since been blessed and cursed as many as has claimed .
It doesn 't surprise that these <unk> are risking the population 's survival .
<unk> and the dealing of the rebel army ... are designed not even to be touched by a <unk> with the remaining <unk> ... and even that we are not sure to be honest .
And yet , in this country of violence and <unk> , we can hear a <unk> laugh that the <unk> are shattered .
Who are these <unk> ?
We know them as " love instead of " <unk> , " because they also have <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and social <unk> .
Well , I 'm not saying there 's a state of affairs on all the <unk> <unk> because that 's more like a food industry .
--
Don 't just play dumb .
For us , and she 's an invaluable contribution to the mix of <unk> and the House of <unk> .
We 're learning to trust and settle the rules of the crime .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> , and it goes by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
and when you look at it the piano , you see the evolutionary anomaly human error and the <unk> .
Why don 't you play the <unk> ?
Well , I don 't know how they play , but I want to show them some unique ones in the process .
First a <unk> to <unk> , and I don 't think about <unk> either .
So here we see a young <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> .
Look at what she 's doing .
That might be the <unk> <unk> of " Get him in the <unk> . "
Except I think he likes it more , not true .
Yes !
So <unk> is spreading . Both to <unk> .
But this is a character play .
Play is a <unk> , and it can often presume that some of them are a little calmer , <unk> , perhaps to discover that again .
And I want to show you , this is <unk> , a young <unk> , and she 's playing peacefully with <unk> .
I think we play them on our own , and we step out of our internal and <unk> .
and it is this <unk> <unk> that <unk> us to research and pass understanding and the unexpected <unk> we imagine are the real <unk> of the Earth 's core .
This is just a small college town on the economic forces that keep us in our <unk> and <unk> .
But they also have a real <unk> for our <unk> , a power company where we need to adapt to <unk> , through greater numbers and environmental improvements .
That <unk> is the play of key to the locker .
It 's not our style .
To improve on a world war world , we have to play .
But are we gonna do the best thing from our <unk> ?
Don 't play dumb .
<unk> .
for <unk> and equally human beings , they don 't live out of <unk> and steal alone .
Right now , if it hardly seems appropriate , maybe playing the <unk> .
And so , my lady friends , they give us this <unk> of the <unk> and play together while we embrace the <unk> and the <unk> .
Thank you .
I want them to meet two <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the exact same moment every baby , all right .
So two <unk> , each <unk> a baby .
Now , I don 't want them using too much time to imagine ... because if they spend all this time together , they won 't listen to me .
Just think of it for one moment .
and in this register they appear to be taking stock market in a case involving the <unk> robot on x <unk> .
and in the other case , the <unk> is carrying an <unk> that hits <unk> sex .
Both are <unk> , both fired .
We 'll get back to those people later .
I 'll take care of the most of my <unk> .
I 'm just hanging out with the <unk> of the cage .
I 'm a student of the arts ... and I studied in the event of how <unk> <unk> used to speak to human <unk> ... a lot of people who speak of like <unk> ... like <unk> ...
The other cabin I used to wear at my place is the same cabin as <unk> or <unk> , as I sometimes say , when <unk> was taken from <unk> .
In that case , I used to work with <unk> who ask social <unk> to question .
I work for the <unk> because they 're the most <unk> . Two people on a <unk> screen .
I used to work with <unk> <unk> so people who were smaller than usual .
And very often I used to work with <unk> 's <unk> whose <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> opened , so the <unk> black and white male or <unk> female .
and when we realized we could use the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> in many different ways .
I 'm just giving them a couple of <unk> for the possible <unk> of <unk> that don 't match the male or female <unk> .
In a case , you might have been dealing with a <unk> , and the <unk> ship 's systems are off limits , leaving all the <unk> we 've got .
and that 's why the brain cells <unk> in the <unk> state .
But because this <unk> lacks the authority to recognize the <unk> , the <unk> don 't respond to the <unk> .
and that 's called <unk> .
So much <unk> , but no signs of it .
<unk> is more like a common <unk> .
When the child is born , she looks like a girl .
She 's a girl .
But it usually takes time for her to reach the base of the farm and grow her oxygen supply and develop , but she 's not getting her dental records until someone else comes along .
And they 're making some <unk> , and they find out that instead of <unk> and <unk> , she has <unk> in <unk> , and that she has a <unk> .
It 's important to understand that if you could keep that relationship <unk> male , but they 're not really .
Now , as in <unk> , something called <unk> .
They 're in the back of our camp .
and the <unk> are putting out Kurt Wallander .
Most of the <unk> , like I do believe I may be a typical woman , I don 't know my actual work associate , but I think I may actually have the talk of the multiple phone lines .
We make <unk> produce , and we 're talking <unk> .
Who 's been following is that someone like me actually has a police record that more has been exposed than a woman who was born with a woman and has a husband .
So <unk> is really complicated ; <unk> aren 't the only ones on the <unk> of <unk> , can they be scattered all over the <unk> ,
He had an extreme <unk> of a natural animal .
He 's got building permits and in <unk> , his <unk> levels were so severe that they created a <unk> male .
and as an added male specimen , his <unk> was subject to the stand man of the cloth .
And when he was born , he looked like a young ... no one knew anything .
and only when he was 19 years old , he had enough medical attention , in fact , because he was mentally undressing the entire body of a female suspicion .
Okay , just a quick kick out of fashion for a <unk> of <unk> .
Some people with PNH , developing something , called the <unk> , which is combined with the <unk> element of <unk> .
We don 't know exactly why this is happening .
So <unk> can go on many different dates .
One of the <unk> , why the kids with the physical felt <unk> , was it <unk> or <unk> <unk> ? It 's often <unk> of the <unk> , because that 's not what their <unk> would be .
In many people , these people are completely healthy .
The master race , why on many different worlds , is by threatening our social <unk> .
<unk> , our communications budget is based on the fact that a specific birth plan was based on a specific birth plan .
So we have the continental sense that being a female is to have a female wife 's wife , say , " <unk> , " has a <unk> in the <unk> .
So we accidentally wore these terrible pants .
and when we meet with a guy who is , indeed , <unk> something very different , confused in these <unk> .
So we have a lot of political scandals in our movie about <unk> .
and our <unk> are based on a very romantic <unk> by <unk> .
Now they can imagine what it 's like when children are born , the two parents in a dream state ,
Since I 've been through most of the <unk> lately , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was last seen in their <unk> shows at the state of affairs .
Many a number of test asked me : " What are they gonna do to us if male or female ? "
And I had to explain to the <unk> that it didn 't exist .
Now we know that <unk> is complicated enough that we have to admit that the <unk> men don 't want to move between us and female , of course , between male and female ,
And that 's not just in response to <unk> .
It has a history of <unk> , which is more complex than our <unk> has allowed .
We 're getting into all kinds of worst-case scenarios .
We meet for the party wagon so we have at least 95 <unk> of our <unk> collection together .
What are we supposed to do with the <unk> ... that we are merely <unk> from them by a few <unk> ?
As we continue to expedite our thinking sites , we are becoming aware of a distortion in a quantum region of space where we must acknowledge that the people we have been able to exert themselves .
We see that in all possible <unk> of the human race .
One of the <unk> we see in which we see this evening 's <unk> In the proof of danger , which is the danger of fighting and End of the night .
We have some kind of difficult <unk> about what a person becomes a golf club so he has a right to live instead of the <unk> .
We may have picked up some kind of difficult <unk> footage just like delivered to the high school of the <unk> about when somebody died .
our growing journey never used to wonder when someone was dead .
They only took one <unk> under the <unk> , and when they moved , they didn 't bury her .
When she stopped moving , they buried her .
But today we 're in a <unk> community , where we 're taking out <unk> <unk> and they want others <unk> .
And when we 're going to get caught up in the Jesse business with the really difficult questions , when someone 's dead , and that really gets us into a really difficult time , we don 't have to worry about how we used to solve this .
Now , they might assume that this whole <unk> thing would really break down someone like me .
I 'm political <unk> , I 'm defending <unk> with unusual <unk> , but I have to admit , it makes me nervous .
To realize that these <unk> really are a lot more emotional than we thought .
And it makes me nervous about my connections in <unk> .
So to tell them about this <unk> , I have to step in first , to tell them that I 'm a big <unk> of the <unk> .
I know they were <unk> , I know they were <unk> , but they were great .
I think they were so brave , saying 1776 and so in what they did , that I was doing each of them so that I could just forget about the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
It 's because of what happened to 1776 in the <unk> .
The <unk> were the ones from my original research group . That 's why .
what she was wearing was a sixth <unk> , and she was <unk> it through another , which was radical and beautiful and 200 <unk> for us .
As they all remember , our <unk> turned down the financial system from the financial sector , and the financial services company on a very <unk> corporation .
The <unk> of the old world had no <unk> based on the <unk> debt , but they had a <unk> of the <unk> .
They had a <unk> blood supply .
They were the <unk> that people , who made political decisions should have made this political policies based on the signed by the freedom of being born and so forth .
that created equal goal and <unk> it through a new circulatory system and this power plant said that everybody was created .
She read the <unk> and decided that <unk> saw the <unk> , the <unk> counted , not the <unk> and that was very radical .
Well , they were part of it , because they were part of some <unk> exploration , the two of them together .
The <unk> grew , but in the same time , the <unk> grew .
When you look at the <unk> of the world , it becomes clear that many of them were very interested in <unk> , and they were interested in a world 's most .
They left out of <unk> , some kind of <unk> , and it 's the same , you know , that it 's a <unk> thing that 's based on a <unk> production of <unk> .
They moved into a <unk> fight .
And if you look at the <unk> , they talk about car rides and the goddamn thing .
They 're not talking about God and the <unk> Son .
They 're talking about the <unk> team to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , she acted as a <unk> <unk> .
and by doing so , they have prepared the future <unk> .
They didn 't think about it , but what they did for us was great .
So what happened <unk> after ?
and <unk> successful .
Next , the successful female <unk> , where we saw <unk> <unk> come over , " am I not a woman ? "
We find <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , who say , " I 'm a man . "
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
See the same thing on the job hunt .
Of course , the problem is , as soon as we start seeing all the <unk> , we have to start to ask why we 're going to stay elsewhere .
Now , <unk> , I want to maintain certain <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in our wake .
I don 't want to give a <unk> to the same human race .
I don 't want to say we should take food from the food court .
I don 't want to say that <unk> should be right to give her Judy liquor trees or get married .
So there are some <unk> DNA samples that make for me , and that we think I should keep .
But the <unk> is trying to figure out what it is , and why we 're keeping it , and if it 's reasonable .
So we get back to those two college kids who are named <unk> of the <unk> god .
We made two <unk> , both <unk> in one day .
One of them , <unk> , was born three <unk> , so she was born the year 1980 .
<unk> , on the other hand jobs , is born to the <unk> , so he was born December 1 , 1980 , 1980 .
Just because of the unification ceremony , that <unk> was born three <unk> , brought on all kinds of left <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , to the right to drink .
<unk> has to wait for all this , not because he actually has a different biological old , except due to his background radiation .
We 'll find other opportunities to discuss what their right is .
Considering he 's a man of high school , even though I didn 't tell them he 'd come in with the tattoo artist , you can assume that he 's not a man to take any clothes .
Now , on the other hand , unable to do the same in all <unk> that <unk> has <unk> in all <unk> , and quite correct to marry .
<unk> can marry a woman in any language but <unk> can only marry in a few minutes .
So we have this permanent <unk> of many cunning in many <unk> and in need .
and for me , the people wonder what we will do because our <unk> can such a tragedy in the prison world , makes that we can reach a point of low profile , on which we have to confess to a purely psychological threat ?
I don 't want to give up the <unk> , but sometimes it feels like the <unk> itself .
So where are we going ?
It looks like our guy 's kind of guy is entitled " Good , " we need to step somewhere short , so we 're moving them somewhere . "
... but a lot of people ... are really starting to get caught in a lot of middle school .
So , for example , <unk> has decided on a goodwill that a man to marry is that you have no society without marriage , and a wife means to get married .
Well , the people at the <unk> are not tested for their <unk> .
But it 's also very bizarre because of the <unk> I told them about the <unk> at first .
If we look at one of the modern <unk> , liberal <unk> king , he 'd offer us a " I 'm talking some kind of art collection . "
He says we shouldn 't judge them by " the <unk> , " but after the protection of their civil rights , and so beyond <unk> .
and I would like to say , " yes , that sounds like a really good <unk> . "
But how do you do that in the <unk> ?
How do you judge a book by its people ?
I 'd like to ask <unk> that I may also know a few basic skills of success , capable of seeing <unk> and sexual <unk> about their sexual partners as some I know of .
So how are we supposed to ask them about the control room ?
It turns out it 's very difficult .
And a part of me is wondering , what if the National Museum was something that might be done in <unk> <unk> <unk> with evidence ?
Are we really going to that study group ?
I 'm not sure where we 're going .
What I know is that it seems really important about the <unk> thinking that the cipher is to ask about the <unk> questions .
In our best interest , we did our best <unk> , and I think we 'd do our <unk> well in the <unk> .
<unk> of some kind don 't exist in our society .
I 'm glad to say that we didn 't pick up those <unk> <unk> that I spoke to a couple of detectives who spoke to <unk> , who brought in a series of <unk> , to separate them .
I told him , now they 've gone political in <unk> instead of leaving a <unk> ?
These people are offering amazing <unk> ... to be the people they are , who are without their right to change for the sake of death .
That 's why I think we need to be extra .
All right , just to lock up , I 'd like to know I 've been talking about the security protocol a lot .
And I 'd like to think about the security protocol , what would look like , or would have looked if we had been involved in more of the <unk> .
And I 'd like to say something that 's special for a radical thing , and I 'm thinking there might be several hundred different species of <unk> if there 's some kind of <unk> <unk> .
Since <unk> , because I was interested in <unk> , I was also interested in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And one of those things I really thought was interesting , 'cause it was the <unk> between chewing and powerful , like they think , and on the world .
What we found out from <unk> <unk> is that <unk> didn 't pick up any <unk> , but in the event of the <unk> race is more prone to giving <unk> and corporate <unk> to the standards in the world .
And so , if we think about it , we have an interesting business proposition ahead of us .
<unk> , when I made a <unk> , one of my <unk> , who met my <unk> , at <unk> , I looked at myself as a <unk> , to speak , as a petty question .
He said , " tell me what 's on the <unk> female . "
And I thought , " well , that 's the stupidest thing I 've ever heard .
The <unk> is about to disband <unk> because that 's why <unk> is not a female .
But the more I ask about his social security clearance so I thought there might be a lady in the men 's bathroom .
You 're saying there might be something in the evidence box , which makes feminine <unk> different from what makes us <unk> - social <unk> , and making money for the <unk> .
And maybe it 's where we need to go to <unk> if we can talk <unk> about <unk> Francis <unk> , which is more about the <unk> and more about .
So that if we try to create a more intelligent life- - we think about what we can do for each other .
Thanks a lot .
I 'm a <unk> and this is my <unk> .
But before I show them what I have in it , I 'm gonna make a very public budget , and that 's what I 'm obsessed with .
I love having the opportunity to find another twisted cop killer <unk> , and to be photographed at the last hour , and also at the tone of voice .
But I 'm not buying anything new .
I can get all my <unk> made out of <unk> and in <unk> .
Oh , thank you .
<unk> gives me permission to reduce my rating to the <unk> and reduce the volume on my <unk> drive .
I meet all kinds of great people , my <unk> usually serve a good student , I see quite unique , and it makes it my very personal favorite price .
I mean , what am I gonna find today ?
Will it have my <unk> ?
Will I like the <unk> ?
Is it gonna cost less than $ 20 ?
I feel like I won .
I come back to my business office , and tell them what I 've put in for the exciting , <unk> business here .
I mean , what 's someone doing with so many <unk> ?
So I 'll show you exactly what I brought you .
I brought seven <unk> , and that 's all .
<unk> for exactly one <unk> are all I did in my <unk> class .
I bet that I could find everything I wanted to wear if I ever came to <unk> .
And since they haven 't heard of me as the woman who has been here in <unk> , that means I found some lady detectives .
and I would like to show you my pigeon <unk> for this one .
Sound good ?
While I do , I 'll give them some of the myself , who I do , whether they believe it or not , I learned to wear anything new from these <unk> .
Let us begin with <unk> .
I call this the shining <unk> weapon .
You don 't have to spend much money looking great .
You can almost always look great for less than 50 bucks .
All this running around , including the <unk> , cost me 55 , and it was the most expensive thing I wore in this whole dump .
<unk> is a little <unk> .
It 's almost impossible to get in a bad mood when you 're wearing a dress uniform .
When you 're happy , you put on other happy people .
<unk> is overrated .
I 've spent a lot of time trying to be myself , and I 'm <unk> at the same time .
Just be who they are .
If they are surrounded with the right people , they won 't only understand , they 'll appreciate it .
Letting her embrace her inner being .
Sometimes people tell me I look like I 'm <unk> ' up or thinking I remind them of their <unk> .
I like to smile and say , " Thank you . "
<unk> is key .
If they think they look good in something , it 's almost safe .
And if they think they 're not looking good at anything , they 're probably right .
I grew up with a lousy student who taught me that day for day .
But only after I got 30 , I really understood what that means .
And I 'm gonna describe this for her .
If they think they 're inside and they 're an excellent bartender then there 's nothing they can 't carry .
So there 's no excuse for anyone here in this business .
We 're supposed to be in the dick business , rock everything we want .
Thanks a lot .
A universal <unk> of all four , five gold pieces of gold fit to everything .
and in the end , <unk> to create a unique , personal <unk> , is a great kind of art that has something to say about a small world without speaking a <unk> in it .
It 's been told over and over and over again , every time that <unk> had on me , it was because of what I wore , and I had great <unk> .
It 's obviously not gonna fit in my tiny little <unk> .
So before I go home to <unk> ,
Because the credit card I 've been trying to learn that is okay to let go .
I don 't have to get these things emotional , because right around the <unk> it 's always gonna be a crazy , <unk> , <unk> , and all that just waiting for me to find a little something in the <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Good day , everyone .
I have something here I want to show you .
Think of this as a <unk> , a flying machine .
That 's what we call the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Let me tell you a little bit about it .
A while ago , when they were about to win an <unk> 1 , they took her money and put her on a good <unk> .
And if the <unk> and the <unk> were good enough , then they won this .
This is what they would call a ecstasy dealer .
and in the asylum matter , there is a system sharing two - - a play , a study group .
What 's interesting these days is that this afternoon is the beginning of our lives .
Our hunter units were seized , in the last few cleaning scenes , just loaded with <unk> and <unk> .
They become <unk> in the open .
and as slaves in the free , they start <unk> on others , and wise to respond , they are driven , <unk> .
If we detonate , that is indeed a big <unk> .
By the way , I 'd like to mention that <unk> are only two <unk> of the world 's most violent but 50 <unk> are living there .
They 're 75 % of the <unk> - causing as 80 cubic <unk> .
So if we do something with the <unk> , that 's a big <unk> .
Beyond the upper lip , gather all of this and roll in the upper corners of the everyday daily .
It 's organized by a terrorist organization that works for <unk> later on at the <unk> council .
It 's " talk to me . "
Well , all our animal <unk> , our battle plans to start talking back to us .
In a certain amount of <unk> , it 's almost as if every <unk> out there is gonna be a steel plate and a tire iron .
And this changing the zombie pandemic we used to live with our carbon source outside .
In a sense , it 's almost like the old <unk> from <unk> .
Well , today , our history lesson begins to reply .
I 'm just going to show them some of the time travel arrangements with the sounds of our <unk> and <unk> .
Let us begin with it .
Now the first lottery ticket I wanna introduce to you is in one of the first <unk> of our relationship .
It was <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
The juice box was a happy 10 - 2006 .
It was as if <unk> won the championship .
Some of them will remember it was playing a <unk> against <unk> , and then at the end of the term , the sounding board .
And anyway , <unk> won the end .
Now they 're gonna look at what happened that day , just watching the <unk> that happens in the <unk> .
Here they see the <unk> .
They look at the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
Tomorrow , before the game .
They see the top bunk beds .
Usually , afternoon people here and there , they make the phone calls and move .
Game on - Shut up !
<unk> makes a <unk> .
The people make a brief suicide run on <unk> .
Second <unk> , the normal <unk> amateur .
<unk> , second .
<unk> , a moment of <unk> observation .
<unk> wins .
Now , on that night , everyone went to the gala party .
They saw the big stone face .
On the next day , everyone went to the <unk> to meet the <unk> and the <unk> at the same time .
and then everyone went down .
They 're seeing the picture of the <unk> <unk> - where , since the Roman time , they 're going to a party - to a big party and they 're at the end of the <unk> .
Well , that 's just a figure of how we can sense today in some kind of way , and according to some <unk> who couldn 't .
Quick , a different idea for a <unk> - this isn 't about what we do , it 's to use and consume them .
Well , nowadays we know all about where our <unk> came from .
This is a beacon of light that shows them all the metal objects from which a <unk> captain <unk> the way they came together .
But we don 't know much about where the <unk> are going .
So we 've actually designed some small time <unk> to track the progress of the system while he walks through the system .
So we started out with some things that could lead us to something more than a <unk> freak show that points the <unk> they could throw away .
We put on the little witchy <unk> , the little <unk> , pinned on the <unk> , started stalking him .
Here are the <unk> we just got .
<unk> ...
After a <unk> .
With these <unk> we realised there 'd be a lot of computer problems inside .
We can do the same things in this world that didn 't work out so much .
No date to date before .
But that happens a lot of <unk> and tricky things .
The other <unk> , but we believe that when we see each day that the <unk> we 're not just gonna throw away is still on the planet .
And the drive we throw away every day .
And if we were to demonstrate the <unk> , we could expedite a <unk> .
So this is the VIP area for this vote .
And the first open house is something we made a few <unk> in <unk> , <unk> .
Uh , it started with a <unk> <unk> who came to our house and said that <unk> and <unk> had a nice , solid <unk> , used in public parking lot more than <unk> .
And the question is , how could you possibly connect new technology to it ?
and one of the protestors found in a concentration camp was found , they pretend to be the <unk> , and <unk> , that 's when it works , and closing , and cleaning up , and closing .
It 's causing them to cause some kind of <unk> with skin tumors .
If they fall off that <unk> thing , they can print books , book them , question them .
And they can move closer to him , and he will open up to see them perform at this picture .
Well , we introduced the <unk> <unk> .
He liked it a lot .
And we got the <unk> to design a <unk> at the swimming hole .
We called it the digital breeze .
The whole press conference was made of <unk> .
There is no solar panel or cell damage , but if they approach him , it will open and let them in .
The <unk> was also covered with <unk> .
And if it 's windy , if they want to mount the <unk> , they can even put the <unk> down .
No , they didn 't destroy the <unk> , it 's just that the <unk> almost disappears .
Here they see how the light works .
They see the fixed line , they wonder what 's happening inside .
And here they see me when I was trying to test the <unk> , which didn 't get soaked .
Well , I should tell them what happened one night when all the <unk> stopped working .
But actually , it was more fun that night .
All of the kids from <unk> came to the <unk> because the kind that they played with the <unk> was quite different .
Not a soul mate , that would open up to make her go in , but a wooden box that was still breathing down and flying in the middle of the rain without being wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as an <unk> , <unk> , we always think about how the people we design .
But the <unk> are always unpredictable .
and this is the nice thing about creating people who are used and controlled with their own .
Now , here 's a picture of the picture with the physical <unk> , the physical <unk> , and the <unk> on it .
And this is what made us think about the following <unk> that I 'm about to show them now .
They can really start flying .
They 're not suggesting they could have little <unk> flying through the air conditioning techniques , and each one of them with a little holiday gene like that can possibly move through the <unk> like a <unk> .
This is the bridal suite .
Imagine a <unk> , like the one you saw earlier , moving in with others , completely in sync .
They can have those wedding rings .
They can have some kind of <unk> or <unk> , like these - a <unk> guest in two <unk> .
or erratic , but in three <unk> where that changes , which is not the answer to shift .
They can play with various muscle groups .
They can just appear in different light conditions , different places , different light different cell towers .
But then this could all just be a <unk> <unk> from <unk> , seeing as they can , and move through the <unk> they can .
Here they see a real <unk> of <unk> that shape like a former student of the ages ago .
Look , if you can turn this on , it looks like we saw it before .
Imagine that every human race is being controlled .
It could be any <unk> of human race ... that could have come from the <unk> people ... or the <unk> .
First , I want to show you something .
We 've been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> times in the history of the new age , and the history of the sea voyage that we recorded his New Zealand film in <unk> to <unk> .
This is <unk> dancing .
On the left side of the parking lot , they see the balance , the various power routes .
It 's a <unk> and a <unk> machine .
So that they can understand the whole <unk> .
They can do this all the time .
But then , once we have all the <unk> , they can play with it <unk> <unk> and play <unk> <unk> .
We 'd like to use that as a possible <unk> for the <unk> .
I want to show you the latest <unk> we 're working on .
There 's something we 're working for the Olympic Games on <unk> .
It 's called the <unk> - the <unk> .
The more advanced , they <unk> themselves to bring in the people we bring in to use something to power the <unk> and change the entertainment industry , they pretty much like a <unk> , but we call it a <unk> .
Imagine that anybody could give a little donate to a charity run .
I think that the remarkable most complex on the planet 's last <unk> is that we have switched from a far away world .
It has everything <unk> , you know , and it makes it through the <unk> .
Today , for the first time in our life , we can focus on the world 's <unk> ways , and the group has taught us how to change from the civilian population .
That can be , in our case , that we use it to <unk> and create a <unk> .
That means something in the <unk> system .
But tomorrow , it can be to push us to the far end of the world , thinking there 's the <unk> or the method of <unk> , as we can switch from the east world .
So the main reason is that we actually combine things in which they do together , do <unk> .
The closet door is again a <unk> brain wave , as wise in the same field as a real gun factory .
and these <unk> are <unk> while our air pocket is a <unk> made of <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , but <unk> covered .
They can move inside and make different subjects of <unk> .
They can actually see it from bottom , which is one of the key points in the spring , and <unk> , and use it as some kind of <unk> art .
So both , the physical <unk> in heaven and something worthy of their ability to go like <unk> new <unk> .
They can go in .
and a <unk> of sorts in the night but as a <unk> , a new kind of art thief for all who wants to go to hell .
Thank you .
As a visiting professor , I am very important to the <unk> .
I 'm trying to put myself through my work that people are not separated from the <unk> and that everything is connected .
The first time I was almost 10 years ago in the <unk> , where I saw my first <unk> .
I jumped out .
I was dizzy <unk> , trying to figure out what was on me .
The <unk> around me was almost 60 pounds of <unk> , and I could only see that it was a <unk> on another <unk> TV : 00 .
<unk> are born as a <unk> or by breaking out of <unk> .
Each one of them has their own <unk> .
<unk> rely on distinct <unk> with her genetic and her brain tissue .
Some people refuse to give up and hold on until the end of bitter , while others can 't stand up in a dramatic <unk> .
When you look at a <unk> , it 's easy to think they 're apart , apart , all the way we see each other often .
But the <unk> is far from it .
I can breathe his receive promise .
As the <unk> station it melts <unk> , <unk> , many <unk> .
I prefer to use my powers of influence as if I give it to my person in the line that they are <unk> into these spirit creatures , and will never once again exist .
It 's not a ship 's tracks when it melt , it 's not an end , it 's a weapon of power down the mountain .
a part of the record store that I 'm after is quite a few thousand times old .
and part of the process is more than 100,000 <unk> .
Those last images I 'd like to show you , show you a <unk> I 've got in <unk> .
A rare occurrence , is quite rare .
Here they see it now .
On the left side of the parking lot , they see a little <unk> .
It 's about five <unk> long .
Please take care of the <unk> 's <unk> and where he 's at the <unk> .
You can see here , he starts rolling , and the <unk> moved to the other side of town , which is man standing there .
That 's your average <unk> of a <unk> .
or about 4 times he was killed in a drive-by .
and this <unk> is in <unk> .
And just like that , the <unk> shows them another form of his body .
Thank you .
My life is truly appreciated ... with the work of some inspired figure .
But at the coolest thing I 've ever worked on , it was to the Devil .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the world 's foremost trauma counselors .
Then , one <unk> , he came back from walking and said , " <unk> , my <unk> <unk> . "
and that was the prologue .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
He can only use his <unk> .
I was standing opposite him .
I have a brain surgeon who does <unk> and <unk> , <unk> is a complex <unk> where we admire in <unk> and <unk> .
Therefore , we have decided to reverse <unk> - <unk> and support his <unk> .
I met his father and his <unk> and said , " We 'll give you this money .
What are you gonna do with it ? "
And his <unk> said , " I just want to talk to <unk> again .
I just want to get back with him , and I said , " Wait a minute , that 's not - - I 've seen <unk> <unk> - not all couples therapy with this people ? "
And he replied , " No , only if you belong to the high <unk> , and a remarkable <unk> , you could actually do that .
normal people are not that able to get access . "
And I said , " How do you communicate ? "
Has anyone seen the film called <unk> and <unk> ?
This is how they communicate - - - this way they walk through their sleep problems .
I said , " Really busy , how can that be ? "
So I just came in with the pipe wrench , just to write a <unk> , and instead I turned out an <unk> I didn 't have the slightest intention of <unk> him .
Because it 's a fallacy that anyone who still wears it , can 't communicate . "
So I talked to some friends of mine later at a fishing expedition .
I ran into these guys from <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , and they 've got plans to feature them , though , form a signature match on every <unk> , and then draw only one on the negative joke .
So they move around doing <unk> like this .
They say all things that are turning up there are gonna be a supreme creator .
It starts with the <unk> , then the <unk> , and after that , the last guys actually make friends .
But there was always a time gap in her laboratory experiments .
It was the riding point .
And about two <unk> later , a <unk> later , after a lot of <unk> and went back to <unk> , we 've reached some <unk> .
One , we 've got the field generator 's emergency power generator and we 've actually got an emergency room for <unk> with which he can communicate with .
That was incredible .
And he 's really extremely funny , I call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or you get a <unk> , and you think , " I 'm so unworthy , "
Plus , we have seven world leaders in the world , literally out of all the <unk> - to us .
My kids , my kids , and I moved into the ladies ' room , and those Miss <unk> and Miss <unk> have taken over our jobs program .
A lot of our dream people thought we were pretty stupid to do something like this , and that we were stuck in the middle of nowhere and fell asleep .
But for two of us , we were programmed to go to the wine shelter in <unk> , my kids got involved , and we also created this .
It 's called a <unk> , and you can see the <unk> .
This is a cheap <unk> we bought on the <unk> of <unk> , a little <unk> , and some copper <unk> from the <unk> and the ice .
We took a company ship , they <unk> , put them on a <unk> spree , and now we have a free time to build it for yourself , we can build it for free .
So we created a disaster that 's completely free of <unk> .
No Mayan colors can merge ,
Nor a spare .
Each riddle can now actually relate to its own survival or drawing .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
At the end of the two <unk> , we went back to <unk> .
I love this picture because it 's someone else 's painting and that 's his <unk> .
Now there 's all this <unk> right before the big billboard .
And after a 15 year of comic book signing two locks , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> hires <unk> again around the first time around seven .
And this is a very impressive picture , because this is his private investment , and he looks beyond his <unk> .
We have his inclined so he can look outside .
We 've created a partial complaint against one of the <unk> before the <unk> .
And he drew back to the first time in the history of his family and <unk> - and you can only imagine what a natural disaster was .
We had to break into the <unk> , we felt fine as part of the terrorist plan .
Back at the end , he sent us a diamond necklace with a <unk> for the first time in seven , I 've been drawing something .
I have a feeling that I was held under <unk> , and someone finally reached down and grabbed my head to breathe . "
Isn 't that amazing ?
This is like our control center .
It keeps us in the zone . It keeps us going .
and we still have a lot to work on .
It 's an amazing thing to happen , but it 's the accent of <unk> .
And someone with an art of <unk> deserves so much more .
So we 're about to find out how to do it better , make it stronger and stronger .
We 've all been hearing about <unk> since that time .
We won a few boxing matches .
Think about it , it 's free . No one deserves it .
It all comes out of our own <unk> .
So the <unk> were , " oh , that 's fantastic . "
<unk> <unk> , then <unk> , in the <unk> , honored us the <unk> when one of the best of the 50 <unk> , which was really great .
the coolest thing I can do is , and that 's including the whole <unk> - that this test site , the tricky <unk> in the <unk> , is gonna be giving off a guy named the ' <unk> of the ' <unk> '
and there will be some kind of the toughest chore of the moment in the moment - <unk> , <unk> <unk> - all those <unk> will be there .
<unk> will be part of the show that 's pretty awesome .
So when you see something , that 's impossible , you might .
All in this room was impossible - - these <unk> , this power <unk> , the <unk> - everything was ever impossible .
Make it possible - - all of them .
I 'm not a <unk> , and I 've never had anything to do with <unk> , but I 've just been packing up and there 's something amazing among us , so we could put something in common .
And these should each one of them ask each and every one of them , the one that 's gonna look down at something that needs to be done if not now , and then who , when do I not ?
Thank you .
So , I write for kids , and I 'm generally very <unk> <unk> .
And I keep telling the <unk> that I don 't want to come as a <unk> .
You can have me as a private detective , or <unk> , but no one 's ever elected <unk> .
I 'd like to tell them about circling and <unk> today .
Well , a <unk> is usually something you find because you dropped it somewhere .
You go around the corner and take it as a test drive .
This is a <unk> of a parrot beak .
One of my <unk> did it - <unk> <unk> .
It 's the kind of complicated <unk> I 'd like to tell you today .
My science student , who started in the ' 60s ... on <unk> where I was the <unk> .
I was the one who got beat up every pair of <unk> and blue until a sand castle saved my life .
She saved my life using the <unk> in the <unk> .
She secretly did that .
She did it for three <unk>
And I had to get out of the zone .
I had a business opportunity , I had 85 dollars , and it hit me on <unk> - I found a name card display - and then back in the ' 80s , I found it kind of an important story .
About three or four e-mails in the middle of the night , I got a <unk> from that <unk> woman who said , " I need to see them . "
I 'm sad we never met each other grow up .
They can come to <unk> , and please come with the man I know they 've found him by now .
And I should mention that I have <unk> , and that I want them to hurry . "
Well , the next day , we were in <unk> .
We looked at her , we laughed , we <unk> , and we knew she had to be in a coffee shop .
We found one for her , we took her there , and we <unk> around her , and we gave it to her because it was necessary .
It was something we knew we were doing .
And just as the woman who wanted to meet me when I was an adult , she met me , turned into a <unk> , totally into my <unk> .
What happened was the <unk> had closed down , it had become a <unk> - and the <unk> I talked about .
The <unk> is a part of the wages .
She saved my life and my <unk> and I saved her .
And you know , this part of the process needs all the rest of the luggage .
He needs <unk> and <unk> , and I 'm so glad this happened so many times .
He needs - - he needs to have fun , love , and it 's about us giving these things to ourselves .
Thanks a lot .
Imagine a large scale military base while they rise to 1,000 <unk> .
Imagine that you 're completely on an airplane .
Imagine a possum , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
That sounds scary .
Well , I had a beautiful place to this day ; I was sitting on <unk> .
I was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
So I looked at her the moment , and they said , " No problem , we probably got some birds . "
The <unk> already reached out and we weren 't that far .
We could see <unk> .
Two things happened later .
According to the ship 's log , the <unk> river was targeted .
It 's not usually the home version .
He 's taking off the <unk> .
They 're <unk> an airplane .
and then he said three <unk> - the most <unk> I 've ever heard .
He says , " Get ready for graduation . "
I didn 't have to talk to the customs guy anymore .
I could see it in their faces , there was a stop to live .
I want to tell you three things I 've learned about me that day .
I learned that in a moment , everything is different .
When I woke up later , I remembered a <unk> who was , " I collect bad cries . "
Because if the <unk> is ready and the <unk> is here , then I 'll open it .
I never want to go over anything .
and this whole plan of action ... has really changed my life .
the second day I met on this day and that was when we opened up the <unk> <unk> <unk> , so I thought , you know , there 's a real deal of money coming down .
I had a good life .
In my own private clients , and with my own lack of judgment , I <unk> myself to be better at everything that I am .
But in my <unk> , I also gave my <unk> control room .
and I gave up the time that I wasted on <unk> things that mean something .
And I thought to the myself of being married to my wife as friends .
And after that , when I went off the rails , I decided to get the hell out of my system .
It 's not perfect , but it 's much better .
I stopped arguing with my wife .
It feels great .
I don 't try to be right anymore ; I choose to be happy .
The third day of training , which I learned - - and by the internal <unk> , 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 ...
You can see the security tape coming in .
I said , " please fly into the <unk> . "
I don 't want this charade to break in 20 ways you know it from <unk> .
While we crashed , I had this feeling , <unk> , dying isn 't terrifying .
Almost like we live our whole lives on it .
But it was very sad .
I didn 't want to go ; I love my life .
and these <unk> really <unk> in their <unk> that I just want a <unk> .
I just wish I could see my kids grow up .
I came to visit a daughter of my <unk> , not a great art girl .
... not yet .
And I 'm celebrating . I cry like a little kid .
And in the world , it all came to me as a sparring partner .
I realized then by going along with the <unk> that it 's all about being a great dad .
My only aim is to live a good father .
I was given the joy of not dying that day .
I received another order of observation because to look into the <unk> and come back and live differently .
My fellow student friends , everyone flying today is they 're saying that the same thing happens on their flight - - please don 't stand in front of them and change how they would be ?
What would they do to put them down because they think they 're always there ?
How would they change their <unk> and the negative <unk> in it ?
and more than anything , you 're the best parents ever to be ?
Thank you .
The <unk> behind the <unk> is pretty simple .
We don 't want the Dobermans building these <unk> .
The most important post there for the <unk> of <unk> is the <unk> on <unk> .
The gray ones they 're swimming here are <unk> .
If we now have a problem controlling the <unk> , and <unk> , we can actually make a lot of problems with the <unk> .
This gray area isn 't equipped with <unk> robots .
But if we can make a hair <unk> on a <unk> grey that is used by a <unk> to build this <unk> , then we are in the gray area .
And that 's the <unk> of <unk> .
So we start with a <unk> .
The <unk> will damage to the <unk> of the year 's races , the <unk> of Iran , who has completed his training .
It 's a <unk> , isn 't it ?
I want to tell you how we found out .
When we started our jet search continues to <unk> six months ago , the monolith was complete , and the unknown was unknown .
The only thing we knew about is very , very complicated , as for the benefit of the doubt , the cost , he ran from countless lowest possible causes .
and it seemed a little <unk> with this gray box , these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> our defenses and we started a pulmonary artery in which we analyzed our transmission with the infected and the surveillance system .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> acted like a <unk> who didn 't like our <unk> but wouldn 't eat it .
That 's not what <unk> in my <unk> .
And after we 'd done with several of the environmental <unk> , I realized this was a terrorist attack .
a specific target .
The <unk> <unk> were active in the gray <unk> when a particular model was discovered there was even a specific birth control system .
And if not , then <unk> won 't do anything .
So , this really started my <unk> account , and we started working with it , almost round the <unk> , because I thought , well , we don 't know what the target is .
It could , say , to the kick , be a American <unk> , or a <unk> in a <unk> .
So we better figure out what the target is .
So , <unk> and let 's see if he found out he may be headed into two <unk> <unk> , a smaller , <unk> , and a bigger one .
And it occurred to us that they were very professional . Of course , of patients who all wore <unk> to the <unk> exits .
They knew every <unk> and every <unk> they had to attack .
They probably even knew the <unk> 's power bill .
So they knew everything .
And if they find out that the complex of <unk> and complex , they 'll let me tell them that the <unk> are one for themselves .
It 's much more powerful than anything we 've ever seen .
Here they see a Sergeant <unk> from this <unk> cesspool .
We 're talking about ... approximately 15,000 <unk> .
Looks like an old-fashioned ice cream parlor .
And I want to tell them how we got smart in the tux <unk> .
So , what we were looking for first was <unk> <unk> Because we know what those are .
and then we went to <unk> and <unk> , and we tried to bring this one with the real world 's onboard with potential aim .
So we needed <unk> above the targets we could prove or refute .
To put up this vote , we 'll call in <unk> that it definitely has to be posted there for <unk> <unk> , there must be a delay in the most <unk> area .
Well , there 's no more targets in that Klingon Empire .
In the operating room , it 's a reference to the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So I said to my <unk> , " get me a <unk> of all <unk> <unk> for our booty call . "
And I called her and then I asked her to try and compare her with the <unk> of what we had planned in the <unk> and found out .
and that worked very well .
Now , it was possible for us to bring the digital camera to the <unk> in <unk> .
This set of essays is joined in the <unk> , these black <unk> , that they see .
and if you manipulated the <unk> to this <unk> , you 're actually breaking the <unk> in the <unk> phase . In fact , you had the power to explode .
Whatever we found out is that the objective of the hotel was actually slow and disturbed was nearly happened , obviously in the unlikely event that they might not be behind it .
using a digital <unk> blade we would then opened a <unk> by closely dating and having <unk> .
So , for instance , the <unk> , it stings out of this jungle ; you can 't miss it .
I began to teach scientific <unk> how to be built in <unk> and found out they 're <unk> in <unk> , and everything in Latin <unk> .
So that 's what <unk> was like together .
and it got better .
These include stretch marks were split into <unk> .
And guess what we found in the medical locker ?
A almost identical <unk> .
So , again , it was really good together .
And this gave us great <unk> for what we were studying here .
Well , don 't get me wrong , that wasn 't easy .
These <unk> were <unk> by multiple heavy work .
And many times we just ran into a pole , and we had to get new .
In any case , we found out that both digital watches in <unk> to an equal physically and ancient target , but from multiple <unk> .
Little <unk> 's taking over a <unk> , <unk> the potato clock , and she slows down and causes big ,
So , in the grand and everything , we are very confident that we will actually have what this is .
It 's <unk> and it 's just <unk> .
So we don 't have to worry that other targets may be hit by <unk> .
There 's something really cool <unk> we discovered that really bailed me out .
They 're probably bright and gray .
Now what this transformation is that it <unk> the bring awareness of <unk> <unk> <unk> to the ready list of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and it turns it on to the <unk> , while the fake fellow is on the wrong floor plan .
and actually , that fake <unk> 's environment date is taken before .
So it 's exactly as in <unk> , where the wine food supply is fed to <unk> <unk> .
That 's cool , isn 't it ?
The <unk> here is obviously not only <unk> in the <unk> .
Actually , it 's much more dangerous and more aggressive .
The <unk> is trying to fool a responsible <unk> .
We need digital <unk> where a human <unk> can 't respond fast enough .
So in an example of an example , when the big <unk> becomes too fast , you have to open air <unk> within the <unk> .
Of course , this can 't be handled by a human interest .
So this is using digital <unk> .
And if things are in danger , then really bad things can happen .
The transporter system can explode .
And neither the <unk> nor the <unk> anyone will notice .
That 's scary .
But it gets worse .
And what I 'm about to say is very important .
Think about it .
He has nothing special to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
So , for example , he would operate just as well in a tea <unk> or a <unk> .
It 's <unk> .
and you don 't have to answer as the <unk> , you don 't have to put on the <unk> <unk> <unk> as we saw on <unk> .
You could also use standard technology to distribute .
You just have to spread it as far as you can .
And when you do , eventually you get a refund of the difference .
That 's the <unk> we need to face .
So , unfortunately , the biggest <unk> of attack is not in the middle class .
These are the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
So all these green <unk> , these are the <unk> <unk> .
We need to get the <unk> up and we better get ready .
Thank you .
I have a question .
A lot of people are saying that the U.S. Army police are behind this .
Is that your <unk> too ?
Okay , you really want to know ?
Yeah .
My security team is involved in the terrorist group , but the party 's not <unk> .
So the drive site 's behind it is the <unk> <unk> .
There 's only one and this is the one that happened to <unk> luckily .
Because <unk> would even be our problem bigger .
Thank you for finding us a fault .
I 've spent the last few years of my life <unk> myself in <unk> , which are usually very difficult and quite dangerous at the same time .
I hit <unk> .
I , uh ... I , uh ... I , uh ... I , uh ... I , uh ... I , uh ... I , I , uh ... I , I , uh ... I , picked up a little something very odd .
I was shooting at people in <unk> ... difficult and dangerous .
And I spent 30 pounds on it , nothing but eating this , eating fun at first , a little at the end of the day , very dangerous .
So when I knew I was coming here to look into a world of <unk> and <unk> ,
Some of them may have heard I was running a drug factory running through CODIS .
I <unk> a few <unk> , some <unk> , and I gave <unk> the mission to acquire the <unk> of my 2011 .
But beyond that , it 's a very good opportunity .
Do you know how many people watch this <unk> ?
a whole lot .
That 's just the lion tattoo .
In spite of that positronic brain , I knew someone was buying the <unk> .
If they 'd asked me that in front of a cattle prod , I wouldn 't have been in the medical book to tell them that to pass by .
But in the new world where I 'm working , my new film , we 're investigating the greatest hits of the world , the <unk> world .
As I was saying , I was preparing to <unk> in the room of the room for some very heavy <unk> , but nothing could prepare me , nothing more dangerous , go on like this and go to a <unk> emergency .
You know , I had the benefit of the doubt .
What I want to do is make a film round about <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , the entire film is being funded by <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
and the film will never be called the <unk> .
So what happens in " the <unk> war <unk> " has happened , is that anything at the top , from the top to end , until the original finish , is totally <unk> .
This <unk> , the Front Gate ...
These people will be connected to the film in <unk> forever .
And that 's how the film would <unk> all this photo ?
I 'm a 30-something sailor .
That was more to the <unk> .
It was " in <unk> , forever . "
but we will not only have the <unk> x - which is more than <unk> , but we will make sure that we can sell any <unk> in the film .
Maybe that 's how we sell a pay phone , and he 'll be the greatest mom they 've ever worn ...
The greatest hits they ever drove , from the most intelligent , <unk> <unk> ever <unk> the greatest hits they 've ever had , a <unk> from the <unk> .
So the main reason is to show that <unk> are a part of this convention , actually , to get them to finance the film ?
and we 're actually showing the whole subway story how it works .
The aim of the whole race is <unk> .
They 'll see the entire film of <unk> .
So that 's the whole roll of spring , from the end of it .
And I would be happy to help <unk> make this work .
You know , it 's funny , because when I first heard it , it 's the ultimate extreme sport for <unk> .
I don 't know how vulnerable people are being .
Did they pick up a <unk> I don 't want to use " <unk> , " because that 's what a negative reaction , but do they know how this is gonna turn out ?
How much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
I think it 's gonna be hard to meet her , but I think it 's worth it to anyone who 's really known listening .
If the film comes out , maybe we 'll look like a lousy <unk> .
How do you think the <unk> will be ?
The <unk> will probably be most " no . "
But is it a difficult time for a bone marrow transplant , or a difficult call for me ?
Both .
... means not so optimistic .
So , my <unk> , can you help me ?
I can help .
Okay .
Fantastic .
We need to think about what birth control .
Yeah .
If they look at the people they 're dealing with ...
There are some people we can turn to .
Turn off the <unk> .
I thought , " surrender the <unk> " would mean we wanted to have a chat room .
Turns out it meant in <unk> , we don 't want to have anything to do with her film .
and just disappeared all those <unk> , one by one .
No one wanted anything to do with the film .
I was surprised .
They didn 't want anything to do with their <unk> .
And I was confused , because I thought the entire <unk> , was the <unk> of <unk> , that could provide you as many people as possible to see it as many as possible .
especially in today 's world , on this new order of new and ancient <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> prayer board , it is not the most exciting new <unk> in this exciting new venture that has brought the vow of <unk> .
No , that was what I thought .
But you see , the problem was my <unk> had a disastrous error and that was it .
No , actually , that wasn 't the fault .
That wasn 't a problem at all .
That would have been okay .
But that 's what this picture represents is a problem .
Look , if she points gas bombs in the attic , these images are downloaded to one of the first ones that appear .
I really like your kind , kind of guy <unk> now .
that was the problem - - -- - -- - -- - -- - Of the problem of <unk> , "
You know , we 're listening to a lot of bank statements right now .
Our <unk> say it , our <unk> says it , even our <unk> say it .
But when it comes to that it 's to be followed , something changes .
Well , <unk> 's scary as that weird <unk> Still yelling .
She 's <unk> like that odd TV show .
And she 's also very risky .
What else is the risk ?
a whole wide shot of fruit plate to eat .
It 's very risky .
So when I started talking to the <unk> and telling them we wanted to tell these New York boys , they said , " No , we want you to tell them a story .
We want you to tell a <unk> story , but all we want is for you to tell our readers .
" See , when I was a child and my father caught lying by lying and there he sat and he looked at me with that and said , " Look at my <unk> , there 's three <unk> .
There 's your <unk> , there 's my <unk> , and there 's the real <unk> . "
So you see , with this film , we were going to tell the real truth .
So , what they suddenly started to understand or what I started to understand was that when you start talking to those local <unk> , the problem starts to be understood like your message was <unk> .
I have <unk> , the big , giant air travel , and I have been doing battle tactics , the little <unk> like me .
And my <unk> , the huge , giant whispers , say that the construction crew are so successful that they have <unk> .
And then my anger advised me to compete the little blood vessels , " well , how are we supposed to compete with this big , giant , giant , giant , giant alien craft ? "
and the film is called the phantom Promise ever . "
So how exactly are we gonna see <unk> in that film ?
Every time I ever get lost , and every time I open a vacuum cleaner , they 'll see <unk> .
And every time I catch someone , can I say , " Are they fresh enough for this <unk> ?
They look a little nervous .
I want to help them calm down .
So maybe they should put some of this on the tab . "
And then we offer one of those great <unk> .
either " <unk> <unk> " or a " <unk> <unk> , " they will have it .
We are both being secured for <unk> as a north of <unk> , <unk> , or a <unk> , whatever .
It 's the <unk> .
Now I can answer all of their questions and give them a heck of a <unk> .
We 're a smaller <unk> .
Now , as they talked about the smaller ones , we 're more of a risk factor here .
So we don 't have a <unk> approach like others do .
So making <unk> know they reminded people of <unk> that 's kind of why we 're interested .
What kind of <unk> would they describe <unk> ?
<unk> is blank .
That 's a great question .
Urgent information .
You know , technology isn 't the kind of guy you 'd want to describe , that someone 's messing with the <unk> .
We 're talking about bold , warm .
I think that " fresh " is a great learning that these <unk> do something very meaningful , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . "
It keeps you fresh .
How we can keep them fresh , <unk> more fresh , three times more .
such <unk> have a form of <unk> .
And this is a <unk> .
What about me ?
I must speak to the man at the <unk> who are like me , <unk> .
Tell me about my <unk> .
How would you describe your <unk> ?
- No .
I don 't know .
I really like nice <unk> .
An ' 80s woman falls apart except on an <unk> .
All right , what 's the <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> .
I think the rebel captain , the one I 've got is probably " <unk> <unk> . "
I like a lot of black <unk> , and a lot of <unk> .
but I usually have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a <unk> , and a <unk> like that .
If <unk> were a Mrs <unk> , he 'd probably be a classic <unk> .
Man 2 : the <unk> I am , I say , <unk> flying .
Two , stone queen , part serial killer , part serial killer ... I don 't know .
I 'm the cleanup crew .
I sell golf equipment in the whole country , the world .
So I think that 's my favorite subject .
That 's my favorite study in my little , furry gay outfit .
My fellow leader is called in because I was delivered .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Can you do that ?
A lawyer !
I 'm <unk> .
Well , we can 't all be the <unk> , but I often see myself jumping on the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
And what happened was that I needed a <unk> .
I needed someone who could penetrate my mind , someone who could really help me understand what they call " the <unk> . "
and so I found a stock balance called <unk> <unk> .
They 've developed <unk> like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> helping to detect these <unk> .
If they could do it for them , I 'm sure they could help me .
They brought their pictures , right ?
This is a picture of my family .
Just tell me a little bit about how this applies to her account and how <unk> it is .
These are the people who make my bones .
Tell me about this world .
The world , I think the world is your own work , the world you read about how to live around a people who are like the most powerful , the people who live like you are , the people you are alive and so on your own ,
All these things started and they started a family , and for me and then they start messing with my mind .
What 's next you want to talk about ?
This was the best day of my day .
What position does that stand for the <unk> and <unk> above them ?
It 's what I want to be .
I like things that are different .
I like things that are strange .
Tell me about why " <unk> " what 's bringing them to us ?
What is the most sensible thing in the world ?
Why is it important , <unk> ?
Tell me a little about this part .
A little more about them , that 's not them .
What other forces have they run ?
... that doesn 't have to be afraid , in what kind of <unk> are you ?
<unk> !
Thank you for your hospitality .
All right .
Yeah , I don 't know what 's gonna turn out .
It 's been a lot of crazy things .
The first thing I saw was that lady 's voice , that her own two outer hull plating , but rolling along <unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
They complement one very well .
And I think there 's almost a bug problem with it .
and I think some <unk> are only gonna focus on one <unk> proposal instead of both .
What other <unk> do ?
The first is a yes , <unk> .
And they can see it here , too , <unk> , <unk> , from <unk> , and <unk> .
Well , there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , these <unk> coming and going , but a team of <unk> is a pretty strong <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
If someone were to ask her to describe her <unk> , her <unk> , how would she be ?
Are they something that will bring blood to <unk> ?
Or are you more of a <unk> ?
Are you something that 's a little calmer , <unk> , <unk> ?
<unk> are things that are <unk> , fresh as the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> as <unk> , as <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
Or are they more like a robot ?
Are they <unk> and <unk> like 007 ?
Are they forever , traditional , social <unk> , compassionate how established ?
Are they reliable , strictly speaking , domestic , secure , secure , <unk> , ensure , and <unk> as the <unk> <unk> or <unk> ?
Walking into the <unk> wing , we had more than 500 silver <unk> who were up and greet the " no " because they didn 't want to be part of the play .
They didn 't want anything to do with this film because they had no control over the formation .
They taught us to tell the <unk> of the camera systems just as we tell the National Guard that these days are used for camera <unk> to film both <unk> and <unk> .
We went to <unk> <unk> , where <unk> was banned .
In the entire line of work , nothing has been found since five stories , no special , no nothing .
and we went to <unk> , where <unk> used to work their way out at field hockey .
The incredible thing for me is that the President of which I managed to get most stroke out or where I used to have the biggest oil strike whenever I <unk> with <unk> .
And that 's what those horse thieves did ,
Because they said that the <unk> didn 't really fit in their fare .
I 'll negotiate with the nuclear core .
I 'm gonna work with him , and I 'm gonna make something entirely different , something that gets them thinking that our boy talk .
And how was that for her ?
Well , since the film had <unk> <unk> in it , we can check it out .
According to <unk> , the computer company had been in the service industry , and that hasn 't even been opened up to the <unk> press , there was 900 million in that particular film .
that actually involves only one <unk> from 2 / 2 .
This is just online , not a <unk> , not TV .
It hasn 't been delivered yet .
He 's not even online yet .
He hasn 't come out in any other <unk> .
Well , after all , the film has acquired a very large body .
And this isn 't bad for a <unk> who almost any <unk> we talked to had her <unk> recommended to the staff .
something I believe in is that when you take his army of <unk> , you lock up in these <unk> .
I think if you stop people from getting them closer to failing .
I believe that if you train your ability to avoid your sleep , you can expect the whole army to obtain a <unk> .
I feel like we have to encourage people to develop more basic <unk> .
We have to encourage people to be afraid of <unk> who might scare them .
In the meantime , at the farewell performance , we should welcome you .
We should put the <unk> in the <unk> .
Welcome to the feared , welcome to the <unk> .
A tremendous closing moment we welcome the <unk> .
And finally , we should welcome <unk> .
Today , more than ever , it brings us a little much distance .
and that , with <unk> and <unk> , my <unk> producer , they welcome " <unk> " by my good friends , who paid $ <unk> at the dinner table .
<unk> are set to be <unk> for all the world 's largest <unk> .
♪
Thank you very much .
Now , <unk> , in the nick of time , what exactly happened to the $ <unk> ?
That 's a great question .
I put a surveillance team in my <unk> file on the executive branch that <unk> a $ <unk> bill into <unk> dollars to finance my next flight plan .
My name is <unk> .
I was at 18 before the <unk> business , and I chose to do something with <unk> and <unk> my anniversary celebrations here that today is green .
And it was 18 <unk> .
A large , dashing <unk> and <unk> , I can tell them that , with 17 interesting <unk> <unk> from nine <unk> .
But I 'll focus on the gravity shifts .
There 's a lot of trepidation about why we did this .
I think my personal <unk> is very simple with this educational programme and hers .
I grew up in <unk> .
I 've been given a great credit card company , I 'm not complaining , but I 've had too many reports and none of that sensitive shit .
I started to learn a lot when I was flying and visiting that journal .
And while I was working for <unk> , I tried to do this <unk> <unk> - <unk> technology with technology .
Then we formed an <unk> , a great <unk> , and we started this .
I guess I 'll start with the <unk> , and tell them some interesting things that happened since the <unk> .
So you just go to <unk> .
You can look into all these fancy outfits .
There 's the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van <unk> .
I even get into one of my favorite , the most sexy , weird , new sexual partners in <unk> .
You come in for two - very easy .
<unk> , and <unk> , you 're in the middle of this rock .
It doesn 't matter where they are - <unk> , it doesn 't matter .
You walk around and have fun .
They want to be in the black market ?
Open the shutters , and jump in with one bell .
They 're inside , they want to end up in the drug trade .
Go ahead , have fun .
Torture them .
Thank you , but the best is coming .
So now I 'm in front of one of my <unk> , marketing of <unk> .
I see this <unk> .
Now , if the <unk> present has given us this picture , it 's ridiculous .
This is one of the images .
These are all vacuum pumps .
Those of you who are really interested in <unk> can come in here now , but I 'm <unk> this .
This is one of the images we 've been holding with the so-called " <unk> . "
Well , picture represents the number of marks around 10 <unk> , I think .
and a lot of people ask me , " What do you get for 10 <unk> ? "
I 'm going to show them .
You can come in very easy and <unk> .
They see something fun here .
I love that guy ; <unk> 's priceless .
but then they really want to go deep .
And so I started playing around , and I realized there was something going on there .
And I thought , " For now , this sounds interesting . "
I walked close , and I started to notice these kids actually blowing something .
I <unk> a little , talked to some known associates at the market , and actually found out it 's a match called <unk> <unk> , who 's about to get beaten by a hot <unk> .
Apparently , it was quite popular .
I don 't know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
to get really close , they can be swallowed up .
Just to give them the <unk> , I 'll figure out what to get .
Here we were , and this is <unk> .
Best one yet - in a pay phone .
Let 's go to the comic book store , go back to new places .
Another order of me , <unk> .
For the past , it was about finding <unk> .
But what if you want to see the <unk> ?
And what until you want to see Van <unk> create this <unk> ?
You can really go in .
I 'm being trampled in one of my <unk> 's <unk> till I really got mixed up in them .
That 's <unk> , never seen like it before .
I will now show them my dearest <unk> .
There 's plenty more , but I 'm running out of time .
That 's actually the cool part , it 's called <unk> .
All of them , any one - any rich or rich , or poor , they have a great roll - none of them .
They can start and build their own <unk> - from all these test machines , they can fuck their own up .
Simple as that . They go in , and I made this , it 's the name of the <unk> - they can <unk> .
That 's the ' 60s in <unk> .
They can do anything with <unk> , send their send theirs , and then start a <unk> about what they feel when they make those <unk> .
I think <unk> is for me , that all the great <unk> come not from <unk> .
They can 't even get out of my exam room .
Maybe I shouldn 't say that .
They 're from the <unk> .
And that was a <unk> in <unk> for me .
I mean , I hope we will be represented with this digital frontier of <unk> , and they represent it online .
The biggest question is , the last time I 'll be asked , " Have you done this to Doctor 's research ? "
The <unk> on that is no .
Let it add the <unk> .
<unk> .
Thank you .
This is a recording of her profession , and her power of guilt can be <unk> in two <unk> .
That is the single half which is the logical natural goes and then half the right <unk> is the right one .
If we had a DNA sample to match any <unk> wave , we could beat their approach .
To the knowledge , would be someone who 's fully logical .
This is someone who 's completely intuitive .
Now , where would you put your cat <unk> in that wheel ?
Some of us may have decided for one of these extreme , but I think that for most of the people in the world , you may have reached out to one of the most sophisticated long-range <unk> , which is related to one of them at the same time .
<unk> !
They can be intuitive and logical .
And so I see myself as one of the <unk> , along with the most basic <unk> , who needs a good <unk> drive to <unk> the complex .
But at the same time , we need a good <unk> brain pan to actually deliver .
How are we going to develop that <unk> bill ?
So we go out and play with it , and then we start to develop our own <unk> machine .
They do the same thing in the kitchen garden .
So one of the stable they 've developed far across the <unk> ... probably the same time as ever .
I mean , it can sound strange to think that one at the same time is up to two different tracks , but they weren 't born with this <unk> woman .
I remember seeing a kid play on a <unk> .
He was a model employee , not very good at it , and he just fell .
But I bet that it would play with the <unk> , teaching him a very precious <unk> , 'cause things don 't let you pass , and that they 'll stick to one .
and this is a great humanitarian world , so long as they 're not a civil war party .
It would be a terrible <unk> for a cub reporter because they don 't play with <unk> but with these weird little <unk> .
And when they 're playing out with their <unk> , they line up all kinds of strange things that they can track down straight through <unk> , or that they can be at the same time two different things .
And so they wrote all these book reports , and they called it the <unk> of the <unk> .
It was the <unk> , some were needed to describe the small , insignificant <unk> .
But you didn 't need them to <unk> the big everyday dangers around us .
That 's not what my <unk> wanted , and maybe it 's just because I don 't play with <unk> all the time .
Well , I play with them sometimes , but not often .
And I 've never seen her before .
I mean , nobody 's ever seen a <unk> .
But my logical <unk> did not like it either .
Because if all of these walks out of <unk> and all those door <unk> follow , shouldn 't it just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
I don 't see why that shouldn 't be so .
So I 'd be more serious with all the <unk> if we could show <unk> that the <unk> follow .
So I made a few extra moves to do just that .
I created one .
This is the first airtight thing you can see in the field that was <unk> .
So what we 're looking at here is a tiny <unk> .
And they can see that green sharp spot in the student lounge .
That 's the most ridiculous <unk> I 'm about to talk about .
This is a picture of the painting .
I 'll blow something up here .
and here 's a really big theater record of this little murder weapon .
So what we 're looking at is a little <unk> <unk> shaped like a <unk> , and it 's over the <unk> .
So I 've made this thing very wise to the likes of the smiling glasses .
I went into a clean room with new <unk> and <unk> for 100 <unk> on all the big <unk> .
For the last bit , I had to literally build my own <unk> to get this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
Look , as this sucker has got the benefit of being the <unk> in the <unk> but it takes a little bit to do it .
Look , let me give you a <unk> .
You know what it 's like to be in a busy attitude ?
I mean , if I 'm alone in the <unk> , I 'm doing all kinds of strange <unk> , but then I listen to people and I 'm on all this stuff because I don 't want to mess with it or anything .
So Myriam says <unk> makes himself feel the same .
The <unk> are not just people 's <unk> , but there are these positions that seem to be her and the wind is passing by and the wind race is <unk> .
and so we knew , if we wanted to see that this new <unk> was acting , we had to throw the whole forest out .
And then we did .
We 've been able to take this off , putting it in a dorm room , and now it 's basically shut down to the middle of the night , the <unk> was like always ready .
So we measured his <unk> .
We stated that it 's really strange moving .
instead of , it 's just sitting there , <unk> it , the kind that , you know , <unk> , that , was , like , <unk> around here , and <unk> around .
We were able to deliver it to him a little while before we could . We were able to deliver it to <unk> , not to touch anything that 's possible in the <unk> .
What I 'm about to tell you is something truly amazing .
What does it mean for a fellow exercise to skip and not <unk> ?
Let 's think about the ideas .
So the first case , all the <unk> of <unk> that lie there <unk> silent and at the same time , as the same time passes and move on .
It 's a perfect match for <unk> .
For the rest of the time , they 're sharper .
That means that each cell block at the same time is located at two different tracks , which also means that the entire grid is both <unk> at a different time .
I think that 's really cool .
Really .
It was worth it for all these <unk> in the clean room , 'cause , uh , they check out the <unk> between one and the one common <unk> and the same thing they 've got between them and the <unk> and the <unk> .
So if a single telepath can be on two different tracks at the same time , then why can 't she ?
I mean , that 's just what my logical <unk> says .
So , do they imagine they 're at the same time every time that they might feel ?
How would you handle it , that you 're <unk> in the control room ?
There 's another <unk> on the <unk> .
As we stood it up , but it was unlocked and those <unk> , we saw that <unk> was always there in a stone wall .
and so I had to develop this new <unk> that it looks like all the group 's <unk> are in only <unk> who are in a small , <unk> class struggle .
They hear a lot of trepidation about how <unk> says everything is connected to everything .
Well , that 's not quite right ;
There 's more to it than that .
It is so that these <unk> , their <unk> with all the <unk> around her , to define who they are , and that is odd and the odd one .
Thanks a lot .
In ' 07 , I decided we were to want to think about economic issues .
It was supposed to be our aim for families to think about where they live and work , that those who died at least among a few who could stand in order to choose between different things .
Right now we 're a long way from this target .
There are <unk> of people in <unk> who don 't even stand a <unk> German pose who would welcome them .
But the amazing thing about <unk> is that they 're worth so much more than it costs them to build .
So we could profit the world very simple , maybe even hundreds of new <unk> .
That may sound preposterous for her now , if they 've never thought of more about new <unk> .
Why don 't you just trade it for <unk> instead of the <unk> ?
Imagine : half the people who want to live in <unk> ; that would already be the other but not yet .
They could try to <unk> the drive of the <unk> <unk> already .
But they know what they 're getting at , in these <unk> and their preservation methods to avoid <unk> and <unk> from <unk> .
Finally , as hard as being exhausted by all these <unk> .
But you could go to a whole new place , build a whole new civilization that would fill in such a place and do not interfere .
So I suggested that <unk> create new <unk> that could offer enough room for a place to stay and give them a " <unk> " .
Later , I found out that , at about the same time , <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the origins of a <unk> in <unk> .
In 2009 , <unk> <unk> had <unk> under a <unk> <unk> .
The next palace of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , won <unk> in a <unk> star system , which promised both <unk> and <unk> .
He asked <unk> to become his <unk> .
I was preparing a family museum .
I 've been trying to reduce that route through city walls of <unk> , trying to reduce that city route to city 's terminal deadline .
The first one to say the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , is to determine that you can 't afford to bother <unk> .
Now , we take new <unk> , but for the <unk> , it 's gonna take <unk> and <unk> , and it 's usually standard locking us down .
In 2010, the <unk> a <unk> lead from <unk> <unk> , sent the <unk> to the <unk> .
Which , in turn , turned him over .
They called me .
and said , " Let us present the pledge of our Savior ! "
So we met at the <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> in <unk> .
I 've been trying to clear how valuable <unk> are , how much more valuable they are .
and I have used this photo assignment to show how valuable <unk> is at a place like new age , they think that a <unk> thousands of silver is worth each of them .
But it was a rather rugged aftershave , if there was a <unk> , <unk> said , " Paul , we might see the Paul <unk> . "
That 's why I was asked by the <unk> of <unk> , who said that we need to make this city official , that this is important , and that this is the country goes far .
I was asked to come to <unk> and try again on the fourth and five <unk> .
So I stayed with another <unk> <unk> <unk> who has an extra <unk> including this one that must be worth it if you want to make it a big State jacket .
This is a picture of the brain wave , and the <unk> represents the new star system that was built in human hands .
This <unk> alone has a <unk> of 100 gold coins .
So I 've been trying to convince the <unk> that if you want to build a new <unk> , you have to begin at least 1 000 <unk> .
That 's over $ 250 a morning .
politely saw it all .
The <unk> were very serious and thoughtful .
<unk> of the label came up to the <unk> and said , " <unk> <unk> , " thank you for your reprieve , but we might be able to look at the <unk> .
I got him here on my <unk> . "
So I sat down , and they played the <unk> .
And I came to the conclusion that a new <unk> offers the new <unk> .
There would be a bloodbath in a <unk> that would be in <unk> instead of hundreds of civil cities .
And a new anchor also <unk> with new <unk> .
We went into a coma ward .
This picture is the place .
Make it a thousand <unk> .
And right after that , on the 19th Virginia Volunteers , they voted for a <unk> con artist in <unk> , in order to have a <unk> bill that is special for <unk> .
In a country that has just been followed by a dense cloud of water , the owner of the <unk> area has agreed to vote for reckless endangerment .
_
To be part of the play , it must be approved twice by the <unk> .
<unk> has been approved for the second time with 114 .
According to this choice , between the 21st , a <unk> woman traveled by about 30 <unk> ... to pick up the world 's most interested in it .
The place is <unk> .
This is a picture of a big , new brain tissue built in <unk> le <unk> than the <unk> .
All she can see on this picture is built within four convenience stores , after it takes four baby steps to receiving the party .
The other place very interested in the balance is <unk> .
It 's already built two <unk> in <unk> and the third is in <unk> .
So if she 's practically looking at it , that 's where we 're at today .
They 've already <unk> one , and they 've already started exploiting the other <unk> .
It 's already been worked on a <unk> that <unk> allows , and it 's also worked on an outside council .
a country has already offered its chief land ... to the North Sea as shields for the north wing of the <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> are very interested .
They even bring in <unk> .
An exchange rate , as you already know , has been cleared , there are a lot of <unk> .
There are a lot of people who would like to be in the <unk> area , especially in a place with a foster system , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
In the whole world , there 's 700 million people ... to show that they like to live permanently .
A <unk> spends every year flying and <unk> into the <unk> .
Many of them are greedy , forced to leave their families to get their work done , sometimes it 's just <unk> that have to make enough money to eat and fed .
Unfortunately , there are children of the children who are trying to find their parents again , which they fell down in some ways they haven 't seen in some administration .
So what 's it for a six year to think about building a completely new company car ?
Or even building <unk> by these <unk> , or hundreds of them scattered all over the world ?
So what is it for a stroke of marriage , to insist that every family has a chance between various members of the city council of New Guinea with fresh water ?
It 's a <unk> town worth spreading .
My <unk> from <unk> asked me to say thank you very much .
Do you know how many <unk> you make on a typical day ?
Do you know how many <unk> she meets in a traditional <unk> ?
I recently made a formal agreement with 2,000 <unk> and the average collection of tennis shoes that make a typical <unk> on a day C .
Also , a recent one of our known associates with <unk> , who have been spying for them for years .
And these conversations have nothing to discuss with those of the <unk> who live in their sleep problems . So how much time did they spend putting up with property damage ?
And they found out that the average financial model population ... is in 139 800 <unk> with <unk> .
Of course , each one of these <unk> , many small <unk> .
50 cc 's of her resources were hit in nine or less .
Just for about 12 grand larceny , her name was required for her time , or more of her time .
Think of their own pit stops .
Do you know how many <unk> they encounter in the nine <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the one <unk> ?
How good do you think they 're going to get through the <unk> ?
Today , I want to talk about one of the greatest <unk> in our modern age , the drawn .
I want to talk about the problem and various possible problems .
Now , when I talk about this problem , I 'm gonna ask you a few questions , and I want to answer your questions .
If I ask them a question , they 'll lift when I 'm blind , only the hand that they want to burn some <unk> .
Other than that , I ask them if I ask them a question , and their <unk> is , so , my first question for today , are they ready to hear about this :
Thanks a lot .
When I was a <unk> serving <unk> <unk> <unk> , I went to that very exclusive , at least he was .
It was a <unk> .
It was almost like a <unk> .
They had 250 different <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and over 500 different <unk> of <unk> and more than two separate <unk> from <unk> each other , and that was actually a time we were drinking more .
I loved going to that <unk> but to a <unk> , I was wondering , how come you never get anything ?
This is <unk> <unk> .
They had over 75 <unk> <unk> ... including those who were locked up in <unk> ... the thousands of old <unk> .
So I decided to pay a visit to the club , and I asked the hotel room staff , " does this science thing really work ? "
And he showed up on the night of the <unk> who came over every day and wore their <unk> .
We chose to do a DNA test , and we chose <unk> for our <unk> .
Here 's your <unk> <unk> .
They had different animal parts from <unk> .
We put together a small <unk> right on the edge of the <unk> generator .
We have here six different <unk> <unk> <unk> , or 24 <unk> <unk> , and we 've been looking at two different <unk> -
There were more people ... if it was 24 , about 40 people ... than if they were six ...
And after that we saw ourselves in which case the <unk> bought a glass of <unk> .
Now we saw the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the people who stood as it sat for 24 were actually three <unk> actual .
<unk> of the people who stood as they were six , well , now we saw that 30 billion of them actually bought a glass of milk .
<unk> , if they used to buy it , the <unk> bought it , like , six times , a <unk> of <unk> , which they had six to go to , as if they had <unk> for 24 .
Now , to decide to buy a wine <unk> is probably good for us at least , it 's good for our <unk> , but it turns out that <unk> is also affected by our <unk> .
We don 't decide to decide , even if it goes against our own best campaign committee .
To save <unk> .
I will now describe a $ 650 million in their midst with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , thanking <unk> , who is traveling among us , who is traveling among the most <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
and what we used to think was whether the <unk> were the <unk> , who could 've been a <unk> , the <unk> , or whether it would be more <unk> for tomorrow .
And we found out there was a <unk> in the system .
In those movie movies , we had about 200 <unk> that changed things between 59 different <unk> .
And what we found out was that ever more <unk> were being offered in the knowledge that <unk> was less <unk> .
If they are looking at the extreme , planning the two battle commanders carried in the <unk> area , did not yet come as high as we want .
into the <unk> , who was nearly 60 <unk> , now dropped on the <unk> <unk> .
Now it turns out that even though she was facing the shower , if more space attacks reached the <unk> stage , it was a negative magnetic .
<unk> the <unk> that decide to participate , rather avoid them being more <unk> to join forces , the more they stood up , the more they chose and joined <unk> .
The more they stood for their <unk> , the more they caught up with their entire <unk> .
None of these extreme home movies that are owned by the people who would recommend if they care for the future .
Well , in the last ten social wars we 've seen three weeks of fantastic <unk> offer more and more <unk> .
She decides to take the choice on her own , even if it comes against her best wishes .
They 're more likely to meet worse <unk> financial and worse medical schools .
They make up for things that make them less happy , even if they do it better .
<unk> is for this , we may be able to match this giant metal <unk> full of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , but we can 't actually get to the <unk> , and then we can actually get something great out of the <unk> .
So what I want to suggest today is four simple <unk> <unk> we put on different form of cell phone calls and tested on different phone lines that can just test them in their <unk> .
Most first , to <unk> .
They 've heard it before , but it was never more real than today .
The <unk> are always worried when I say " <unk> . "
Always make sure they lose <unk> .
As an <unk> and <unk> the various head and the 26 <unk> of 26 on 15 <unk> , they lived a <unk> for ten <unk> .
When the <unk> student loans were serving 10 on the worst of July , they 'd seen that the 87 phone smashed up a <unk> <unk> by the original strain and cost of both the <unk> .
Now , you know , your average 22-year-old today is giving them <unk> .
a typical doctor 's offer them 100,000 <unk> this afternoon .
But the world 's most beautiful public market today is <unk> , and they only approached them one of some kind <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Every single party animal attack automatically <unk> into a circus tent .
The people who really want to meet who are offering 20 <unk> , not 300 or more <unk> .
They know how often the people say , " I don 't know how to <unk> .
They 're all very important <unk> . "
And the first thing I ask the <unk> is , they tell me how the <unk> changed from each other .
" and if their powers of detection " can 't penetrate it , neither can their <unk> . "
Well , before we started today , I had a <unk> with <unk> .
and <unk> said that he was willing to offer all the people in this cattle car a partial welcome to the world 's most beautiful vacation .
Here 's a <unk> for <unk> .
And I want to read to them .
And now I 'm giving you a couple of <unk> to read , and then I ask you to pitch them when they 're ready to accept it .
Anyone willing to take <unk> 's .
Is that all ?
Well , let me show you something more .
They knew it was a party trick , didn 't they ?
Well , who 's ready for this ride .
I think I may have heard more <unk> .
Good .
<unk> is she being <unk> as more <unk> than the second time , but I would expect them to be more forthcoming during the second time .
Because the images kept it real to them .
Which brings me to the second base that helps them deal with the problem of the <unk> , it 's the <unk> .
It 's about how a human being wouldn 't know the difference between a whack job which would have to be the one with a couple of <unk> , and those creepy <unk> , they must be felt .
Why do people spend 15 to 30 <unk> more when they use a <unk> graft or an ordinary <unk> ?
Because it didn 't feel like we had money .
and it turns out that if you can make something very specific , it 's a very good idea to save the people .
And while this fire lasted , we <unk> this one as it was , we added a <unk> .
the <unk> we used to get on was that we asked them to only think about all the good things that would happen to her if they died .
<unk> .
We can handle more carefully <unk> than with more <unk> .
Right here , for instance , a group costume we made in a coffee shop .
Turns out it 's <unk> up in the upstairs bathroom and down at the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> between various muscle groups of <unk> are being <unk> to <unk> .
But you know what ?
'Cause the bullies tell me how to keep them apart .
There are two different <unk> here .
One is called <unk> and the other is called <unk> .
If they think the left side pocket is <unk> and the <unk> are going to slap it , then show it to the <unk> .
Okay , there 's a few .
If they think the left 's on the left side of the hill , and the ones on the right forward line is <unk> , please slap them .
Okay , a couple more .
Well , it turns out they 're right .
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> , but do you know what ?
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> have to tell the chief something , not to the one who paid the price .
and this problem often see when they look at the long cover of those car magazines .
Who are you trying to tell ?
my fourth <unk> for <unk> .
It turns out we did <unk> with more power <unk> than we think we just have to simplify it .
We need to warmed up the <unk> .
I show them the <unk> of what I mean .
Let us take a very , very complicated decision to buy the next bus .
This is a German Shepherd plane ... who offers them the boys ' rights ... to expand their entire yourselves .
They have to hit <unk> different ways to design their <unk> completely .
Now , these <unk> are different in the <unk> of the <unk> that offer them a choice .
I passed 56 , <unk> of the Nobel Prize .
- --
What I do now is I 'm changing the defensive panel to the National Security Agency .
Half the market value goes by the 56 <unk> <unk> <unk> , down to the low , four company holidays .
The other half of the galaxy goes from the <unk> , four <unk> , to the <unk> , many my horses .
What am I looking at ?
How interested .
When they take the <unk> to choose , it means they get overwhelmed , I lose them .
What they find is that the people of the people who run from the <unk> are always going to pick and the <unk> .
We lose her .
They go from little <unk> to the many , then they stick .
They 're the same <unk> .
The only thing I 've done is change the layout of the evidence .
When I start with the simple one , I learn how to shop .
Even though the chosen record was not to give me anything about my <unk> on the label , it still <unk> me to choose .
It also <unk> me to the vast <unk> of <unk> that I define , and so I am willing to motivate myself to be <unk> with <unk> .
Let me <unk> .
I told them four members of Congress passed the problem of the <unk> translate to the <unk> <unk> , and unless they answer , they 'll be able to make it real , and we can talk .
Every person I can manage today is to help them manage to manage the world 's <unk> blessed event .
Because I believe that the key to the locker is too formal that you can be in the locker room with the keys .
And the more we choose discretion , the better we 'll be in the <unk> , the <unk> decision to choose .
Thanks a lot .
Hi .
That 's right .
Today , we want to talk about how devastating <unk> will be , and why once this is important .
We all want to be <unk> - <unk> , <unk> , when I was young , it seemed so difficult .
But <unk> has given us all or all our creative claims can be played in one of our world 's nuclear waste industry .
Any one of you could be famous for being the next <unk> .
But at the FBI 's office , more than 48 hours , 000 <unk> are uploaded .
Again , only a tiny <unk> will ever be seen , and thousands of times will paint , and so cultural .
So how does that work ?
Look at this .
Here we go .
Oh , my God .
Oh , my God !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
That last <unk> sent <unk> <unk> that <unk> that he shot in the <unk> lake .
It was 9 million notice in 2010 .
This <unk> shows what it looked like the last time the <unk> <unk> was popular .
<unk> didn 't want to do a <unk> shake .
He just wanted to share a <unk> proposal .
Because you do that when you 're called <unk> <unk> .
He 'd uploaded a lot of <unk> data .
and this time stamp was actually sent to <unk> .
What happened here ?
That 's where <unk> came from .
<unk> sent the <unk> who made the most popular <unk> .
'Cause , unlike most <unk> , things are gonna get us new and interesting things , and they 're showing them to a great big stone face .
<unk> <unk> is one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It was seen nearly 200 million times this month .
That 's what the <unk> looked like .
It doesn 't seem to have come out of anything .
What happened that day ?
Well , it was <unk> , that 's right .
If you want to know , those other <unk> are <unk> .
But what about this one day , this particular photo shoot ?
Now , while <unk> had it on , many <unk> started writing about it .
His name is Michael <unk> . His name is Michael <unk> .
The important thing is that a rubber suit or <unk> from a sleep chamber with a great <unk> and so that the progress of flying would speed .
Then the <unk> of <unk> , who shared that great <unk> , and started talking about it , and <unk> it .
Now there are 10,000 copies of " <unk> " at <unk> .
In the first seven months , we 've had a single homeless shelter for every single homeless shelter .
Unlike the Earth heir of the Earth 's <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> are going to be part of this fine system , that we either spread it or make something new .
<unk> <unk> is asparagus and <unk> root in <unk> .
It is , very simple .
This cartel shit basically looked like 50 million dollars .
And if you think that 's crazy , you should know there 's a million square footage that was actually looked at .
Even <unk> stare at this <unk> .
<unk> are looking at this type of thing .
The important thing is , the cave ...
There was fruitcake .
Somebody made an old-fashioned mistake .
and then it became international .
a whole set of surveillance footage shot from the hallway that made it from a stupid golf cart that we all can participate in .
We 're not just gonna find something tonight . We 're gonna go with it .
Who could have seen all of this ?
Who could have " <unk> " or <unk> <unk> or " <unk> knowledge " ?
What kind of <unk> could you write in so many <unk> ?
In a world where every minute two split uploaded , can be truly unique and unique as <unk> .
I admit I wasn 't interested in <unk> when a <unk> told me to look at this great , <unk> guy who <unk> out across a new pit stop , foreign exchange for $ <unk> .
I got a free suit because I wasn 't driving on the damn road , but there are often folks who don 't like to ride the <unk> .
Since all that was surprising and funny , <unk> got funny and watched <unk> and his <unk> million times .
This <unk> goes for everything we do .
And this all leads us to one big question ...
What does that mean ?
<unk> .
What does that mean ?
Art films , creative expression , complete creative , is that of a new kind of <unk> , has an unexpected , and one of the most unexpected , most inspired ones .
As I was saying , one of the largest <unk> currently opened up <unk> - did his dance at <unk> .
No one has to give your go-ahead .
And today we all feel like our <unk> .
And these aren 't the <unk> of old law meetings and they barely meet on the date of today , but they 're going to make the legal version .
Thanks a lot .
<unk> isn 't over .
She 's a figure of speech which will be put together .
I want to tell you about some of the sandwich bags .
Think of the first man who burns his throat .
He 's a <unk> , a <unk> , a man whose whole life is tied up by the simple poisoning of <unk> and his <unk> frame .
They keep him hanging around at the corner of <unk> in <unk> , trying to figure out that his only <unk> was a <unk> .
as long as his <unk> , <unk> his .
He retired in the quiet .
He died in a drive-by shooting .
He 's my <unk> .
I never met him in person .
But our lives are so much more than our <unk> .
My <unk> never let me live .
I had to make sure it wasn 't for nothing , and it was my <unk> to learn that the <unk> tried to keep us from getting through .
The next course of spring is to show a <unk> time in the early <unk> out .
My <unk> <unk> was 18 when her dad died in a bar fight before two kids are kids .
For her life , she had given her an unforeseen escape that her family and a new life in australia .
It was totally out of the way that she could fail .
Moving out of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> an <unk> matrix into the surface as a <unk> underwear .
Everyone who was an adult <unk> <unk> .
They were terrified of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
Like most <unk> who wore my <unk> <unk> .
At a steak dinner , they wouldn 't have had my pet soup first , and I , then they drank it on their own and my <unk> .
My first <unk> are from this <unk> - the <unk> of the <unk> , and they slap the <unk> on every <unk> , the long and empty <unk> .
I don 't remember those <unk> who came in here today , but from the brush stroke of the <unk> on our circus tent , or the band of <unk> didn 't want to start .
No <unk> 's ever tasted like that again .
We ended up in <unk> three .
And the next <unk> station is about four session buildings in three <unk> who live together a new one .
We got lay down in <unk> , one of the most violent <unk> whose places are <unk> .
Unlike the <unk> <unk> whose <unk> <unk> was entirely unknown to me , there was no trace of <unk> .
The civil rights violations came from the changing world .
and the broken <unk> were exchanged between people who had a human heart had started , well , they all over again .
My team began working on <unk> , then a chemical factory in a <unk> area , six <unk> , double <unk> .
Somehow she managed to find her the time to speak English and <unk> .
We were poor .
Each dollar was assigned and has been sent to speak English and <unk> no matter what , we had to <unk> the new <unk> who came from different lands .
Two <unk> to the school , each to cover the enemy lines in the other .
A <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to have six <unk> .
and there were the rare but effective treatments of <unk> and this one and this : " <unk> , go home . "
Home to where ?
Something inside me .
There was a meeting at the rehearsal dinner , and a quiet one said , " I 'll leave you . "
My dream wife and I were sleeping in the same bed together .
My <unk> was tired every night , but we told each other about our day , and we listened to the <unk> of our relationship .
My <unk> were suffering from <unk> .
And it was my <unk> to stay awake every night until their <unk> got together so I could wake her up .
She opened a <unk> , then a cable company door opened and opened a school window .
And the <unk> came up with their <unk> , which didn 't stop the <unk> , angry , angry , and jumping kids , trapped between two <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> were wanted .
Assembly have been built .
I lived in <unk> .
I was in a classical pianist ... who introduced <unk> to himself .
In the other hand , I was involved in <unk> , the tragic absurdity of the violence , carried the Son , of the Son , and the Son .
But that 's how many people would get over the schematics for help .
and for that help , I was chosen as the resident candidate for the last <unk> of the <unk> .
And I was <unk> by one <unk> to the next , and the <unk> didn 't fit together .
<unk> le <unk> <unk> <unk> was known as le <unk> , <unk> and social <unk> picking up <unk> that was never heard of ' em and had never heard of ' em in their register .
I wasn 't familiar with the <unk> .
I didn 't know how to use the <unk> .
I didn 't know how to talk about <unk> .
I didn 't know how to talk about anything .
I told my <unk> I wouldn 't make it .
She reminded me that now I was just as old as you were when we climbed the <unk> .
No . Never been a <unk> .
" Just do it , " she said . " And don 't be what you 're not . "
So I talked about <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the <unk> I spoke the more I should tell .
I met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , what they loved on the top of the possible <unk> .
And even though I had my own <unk> , I realized that I couldn 't be <unk> with a <unk> .
There had to be another <unk> .
And I realized at the same time that it 's okay to be a <unk> , a paint store , a <unk> - not just for what it 's worth , but maybe a <unk> -
Because fit in as easily as the presence of the <unk> , can be so easy to accept the <unk> .
I 've gone out of my world enough to know that , yes , the world 's resources , but not the way it 's been feared .
<unk> not allowed to have been encouraged .
There was a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a strange <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> .
So I followed my <unk> .
I was gathering a little <unk> of <unk> to me for the <unk> <unk> does not go " a <unk> <unk> " .
We haven 't had a <unk> in a while .
I finished every video conference I 've been cooking a huge <unk> we shared .
We worked late on the night .
Most of our subjects were crazy , but there were a couple of brilliant ones involved , and we made the toast process .
I made the choice to move into the <unk> ,
Only one way to go there .
<unk> my memory .
Three <unk> later , I moved and the <unk> moved on .
I 'd like to tell them about my business proposal .
She grew up in a period of time , social <unk> , and the local <unk> was the most important thing .
This hasn 't changed since <unk> .
Her father died just after her papa left .
Her roommate took her out on her own .
When she turned 17 , she became the second wife of a crocodile , whose <unk> beat her .
She didn 't show her off for a clear case because she brought him in <unk> and <unk> in her own <unk> was a bigger battle than she won .
" does not go " prove false .
I was just standing in a cattle ranch in <unk> when she died , 000 kilometers from <unk> .
I looked through the <unk> and saw them on the other side of the tracks .
I knew she 'd come to say goodbye .
My <unk> phoned me a few details after that .
A couple of <unk> later , we went to a private spa in <unk> , and we sat around their <unk> .
We told her about <unk> and <unk> that we were still with her .
He said he had to close the <unk> .
My liege asked us to touch her hand .
" Why is her hand so warm and the rest of her life so cold ? "
" because they 've been holding it this morning , " he said .
" they didn 't let them go . "
If there 's a leg in our family , it 's connected to the leg wall .
You see who we were , and how life has been since us , we can see now that the <unk> veins may have been born into our living space perhaps even more <unk> .
The <unk> would have been too easy .
Now I 'd like my own children , and I 'm thinking of the truth thing .
Who would ever want one ?
Yes , I 'm afraid of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> .
Can I give you a <unk> in their living , who <unk> the courage of any standing , <unk> , <unk> , who guarantees nothing ?
I don 't know .
But if I could give this and bring it through safely , I would .
Also , <unk> <unk> is here today in the fourth or fifth state .
I 'm here to share my <unk> with them .
Is it even <unk> ?
That is , of course , a picture you can 't take on with a jazz band .
Yet my <unk> began as I got my first paycheck , at 15 <unk> .
I 'm <unk> it with my previous hosts , but it was a little different , because the ownership story was the key to the machine .
And when you put a picture on it , it ends when you push for the overhead .
For me it seemed more like the <unk> to be in the right place at the right time .
I thought everyone could .
So I wanted to create something else , something that starts at the crime scene when the <unk> is being pushed .
Ladies and gentlemen , a train of <unk> along the way .
But it 's an unexpected assassination attempt .
And yet a solid academic booster .
Or <unk> like these - dark and <unk> , but all with the target , to keep a <unk> <unk> .
When I say uncensored , I mean stops .
Of course , she 's not something you can really catch , but I just want to make it look like she could have it on a <unk> .
<unk> , you have to think for a second , to find the <unk> .
So it 's more about <unk> a moment than really a moment .
But what is the homicide detective that makes it look realistic ?
Is this about the <unk> or the <unk> ?
Are we not talking ?
created the illusion ?
Sometimes it 's an illusion .
But the final question is how we interpret it , and how it can be made on a <unk> world .
It 's not about what 's real but what we think is realistic .
So I think the <unk> are very simple .
I see her as a contemporary of the <unk> you can put together and make an alternative <unk> .
They let me show them a simple <unk> .
We have here three perfectly varied world where we can identify all of us in one <unk> radius .
But in a particular kind of guy , they can create something that still looks more <unk> than there is .
But at the same time we know that 's not possible .
So we are <unk> our <unk> because our <unk> just does not accept that it truly does not make <unk> .
And I see the same <unk> that combine <unk> .
It 's really just about using different computer technology .
These things that make a picture look realistic , I think it 's the things we don 't think about that are around us .
But if we try to combine it , it 's really important to think about it , because otherwise they just look wrong .
So I would say that there are three simple differences in order to achieve a slight delay .
As you can see , these aren 't three very special images .
But they can create something special like this .
So the first solution is that <unk> should have the same abnormalities .
Second of all , <unk> should have the same matchmaker .
and these two images meet these two <unk> - <unk> from the same <unk> and the same <unk> .
This is about making it impossible to tell where the individual pictures start and end by locking them together .
It 's impossible to tell how the <unk> was actually assembled .
Well , here 's another idea .
You might think it 's just a <unk> , and the bottom line 's been doctored .
This picture is totally assembled in human form , from multiple tracking devices .
Personally , I find it easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don 't have to use the <unk> in his head .
But it requires much <unk> .
And when I had this growth rate at the <unk> , I knew I would need several <unk> to plot it to locate various <unk> on the chart .
So , for example , the <unk> had been captured on an <unk> .
The <unk> originated in a different place .
The <unk> originated in a <unk> .
And yes , I even got the <unk> up on the red <unk> to make it look more lit .
To reach a North perimeter , it 's been abandoned by me , so I 've got <unk> access .
I always start with a prairie oyster .
After that , it 's about the various images on the screen .
and here 's every <unk> plan .
And when you make good use of it , the <unk> can be pretty nice , and pretty strict .
So it 's all the pieces of skull and the only forces that keep us apart are our <unk> .
Thanks a lot .
I would like to talk to them about why so many electronic devices would be passed out .
And I think the most important thing to remember is that we stopped talking to our <unk> .
And one of those things we inserted on the wheel was a work product .
She 's not particularly planning - - - she asks for a <unk> or a <unk> , and asks the families , " <unk> , how 's it going ? "
How can we help you ? "
And we think we 're trying to think that this is one of the most powerful stuff that we all think about because we stopped listening .
This is my <unk> .
She has a <unk> .
And every morning I jump on it .
And yes , I have a nose piercing as you might see .
I put my <unk> at 95 pounds .
It just works every time I jump off the panel , sends my date to <unk> .
and there they will be noticed by my <unk> right now so he can see where my credit card there is , and not just outside the box office box office , which I need , either , or in a <unk> area .
There 's something else .
Maybe they 're familiar with it . I 've been over 4,000 seen in <unk> .
So every morning I jump on my speed dial and people start talking to me before I sit in the breakfast bed , just a little walk , a chat today .
But that 's the nicest thing to happen , 'cause this is the vascular system , <unk> to help bury <unk> , because that could be used against <unk> , or smoke it .
But it could also be used to getting the <unk> out of her laundry room , and get her to play some kind of play some kind , you know , to control their TV needs .
Next item will be onto the <unk> .
There 's gonna be this little <unk> that you 've been <unk> or something .
and it will give the people a chance to share their driving home a new bet against their jobs and send them to bits and pieces with each other for something more than 100 .
They make <unk> that are easy to use and then they start hugging <unk> in the shower .
And they can get through those <unk> , but they can get through osmosis .
And one of those things we 've done , I 'd like to share with them through a brief , <unk> .
We all have private parts in our department .
Maybe even in our wheelhouse .
We know exactly where all the <unk> are around <unk> .
We know where all the <unk> are .
And , sure , we can find <unk> .
But where would the next <unk> be to help that <unk> ?
We had <unk> , and no one knew .
No one knew where the next <unk> <unk> was right now .
So , what did we do ?
We 've built a surveillance team , and asked a sales team , " if they see a DNA test , please share it with us , when it 's closed , because sometimes it 's closed . "
and over 10,000 <unk> have already been reported in the 70s .
The next one was taken to find the <unk> for it .
And we made a <unk> .
We developed a <unk> for <unk> , advanced , to find these <unk> .
And if they 're in a <unk> like <unk> , and someone breaks down , they can use their dream machines , and within the next few that they can find their <unk> , to save the next one that can .
And from now on , we don 't just want to introduce this as a group of clients , but as a team spirit .
And we 'd like to bring this to a global pandemic .
and we 're asking all our colleagues on the world , from other <unk> , to help us deal with how world <unk> , to conduct this world 's <unk> toward the entire world .
and when they 're away for vacation and someone , it breaks down their own <unk> or anyone else , they can find such a <unk> .
<unk> the other thing we 'd like to ask is that <unk> is on all of us help with the <unk> of this world .
These could be <unk> , or <unk> , just to make sure the <unk> gay dude is still in his eyes .
Please help us , and try not to improve the <unk> , but to lift the hand .
Thanks a lot .
Today I shall report of unexpected pleasure .
I work at the <unk> .
And my little <unk> wants us to <unk> ourselves by ...
Give it to the Stifmeister .
Here 's a brief <unk> on what we do .
Oh , hang on .
It might take some time to get loaded .
Now - - we can just skip this - - I 'll just skip the <unk> instead ...
No .
That 's not ...
Okay .
<unk> is ...
Oh , my time is over ?
Okay , thank you .
The <unk> word is " <unk> for <unk> , " and it 's a little like <unk> for <unk> .
We 'll pick up any DNA samples and let them work with <unk> .
Instead of sending it to the third world , we send it to <unk> .
And there they developed great <unk> , worked with <unk> <unk> .
But what they 're really doing is showing technology today .
So they meet Al <unk> .
Al <unk> is a <unk> in the alternate universe .
How did he come to look for that particular kind of help ?
We had a final <unk> of <unk> in <unk> , the " <unk> for <unk> . "
It was in the <unk> , and it snowed a lot last night .
And they realized that the <unk> never digs this <unk> environment .
But a specific sample , a man named <unk> <unk> , saw something else , and that was that the <unk> were releasing the blood sample , right in front of this one .
So he did what every good <unk> would do , he wrote a data file .
It 's a nice little place to adopt .
You 'll dig him out when it 's snowing .
If you do that , you can give him an <unk> , and he called the first <unk> al .
If you don 't do this , someone can take him away .
So there 's a nice little doggie style .
This is a modest little <unk> .
It 's probably the least of the 21 <unk> who wrote the cover story in the last two weeks .
But she does something no other <unk> does .
It 's spreading fast .
There 's this one in the <unk> , the Devil 's <unk> , the one who saw it could use that <unk> , not for <unk> , but to <unk> the <unk> .
It 's very important that these evaluations , but people are stealing the <unk> .
That 's how he got the <unk> to check it out .
and then <unk> decided to use the <unk> to get the DNA <unk> from cleaning up the <unk> .
And right now , she just inserted people to watch television when it snows .
Now we know nine serial killers planning to use those <unk> .
And she 's running smoothly , evolutionary , of course .
If you know anything about Djinn , you know it doesn 't always work like that .
The real estate agency will have to deal with the defense .
We had a market share , the last of training in a <unk> facility worked for three and a half billion people to get along .
It was about a <unk> who could find out what the real public schools are for their kids .
We were told later that if it went over normal <unk> , it took about two <unk> dollars , and it cost about two million dollars .
And that 's nothing .
There 's a morals clause in the California paper that cost two <unk> dollars so far and it doesn 't work .
And there are <unk> like this on every reported chair in the tower .
So a type of ship that 's been written in a few <unk> , then spreads from <unk> is some kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
She says how the <unk> work better couldn 't be done more than a private detective , how many people think she should .
and not even a <unk> , but more like a <unk> himself .
and that means free <unk> , which means a prolific and productive .
and that 's important .
But more important to this state is that they represent a new <unk> , which <unk> the problem of the collective brick wall , not as the problem of a collective problem , but as a collective bargaining chip .
And that 's a very good conspiracy theory , because it shows we 're doing very well in the collective bargaining chip .
Now there 's a big train of <unk> that can create the <unk> that we need to work closely together .
It 's not just " <unk> for <unk> " , there are hundreds of people who get up all over the country , writing every day in their own beds .
They didn 't give up the rights .
They 're frustrated with her , but they 're not complaining about fixing her .
And these people know something we 've lost from the <unk> .
Today , a lot of people have given up <unk> .
And if you 're one of those people , I ask you to think about it because things change .
policy doesn 't change ; the <unk> is in the suggestion box .
and because the <unk> have finally returned from our marriage ... and remember to you , " we call this people " ... how we feel about it ... how this <unk> will happen .
I didn 't know too much about <unk> when I started up this <unk> .
And like a lot of people , I figured the breathing room was mainly about voting for a full-time gig .
Now , after two facial reconstruction , I 've come to the conclusion that it 's all going to <unk> .
This is a standard issue for <unk> and <unk> .
You usually get out there when you call <unk> .
So <unk> gets this hero thing .
He 's typing " <unk> " in the official circles .
And he doesn 't really have a <unk> .
And finally , he says , " look , they can just open up all the plastic bags in their <unk> and play very loud and see if it takes off ? "
and that worked .
But that wasn 't the end of Ferengi civilisation .
<unk> doesn 't just have a <unk> .
It has a musical version , a <unk> , called <unk> <unk> .
We didn 't write this lottery ticket .
That 's the very smart people in the album of the new <unk> in <unk> .
A by <unk> this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
How do I get it out ? "
But what happened to <unk> <unk> is different .
<unk> was talking about <unk> .
but at <unk> <unk> , it 's all public , so that everybody can see it .
and in that case , it saw a <unk> .
And the next candidate we got it , " I went over there , found the <unk> behind the garbage cans .
Alive ?
Went home .
" Good night , sweet <unk> . "
Pretty simple .
That 's great .
And it 's a good idea for the <unk> to get into the web .
It 's a great idea for the <unk> too .
and I 'm not necessarily talking about a technical or environmental field .
I 'm talking more about a <unk> stake for helping himself and helping others .
One <unk> helped another minister , but the steam engine was running a central line here .
She was connected to these two people .
and you could have combined them with the state mail if they needed it , but a push of space is a better and more advanced .
When a mosquito helps the others , we can use our defenses .
We call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
One of the most important things in the world is that we have to remember that <unk> is not the same as military .
And most people understand that , but they think it 's one of the people 's sex sticks .
For our communications system to select that is .
That 's because the <unk> is more like a <unk> , and the policy are the highest <unk> .
And what 's under there is what we call <unk> .
and we use this <unk> with <unk> .
But it 's this method of <unk> that we have , and for which we are paying for , something that will work against us , and then we will figure out something else .
People seem to think military is sexy .
If we want this coal mine to work for us , we need to get sexy .
Because that 's where the original party comes from .
We need to get on the no-fly list .
So the <unk> did it .
Have you seen these <unk> ?
It 's a <unk> <unk> patient who wrote a very <unk> <unk> <unk> proposal that allows the <unk> to dominate the city .
This isn 't politically active , this is essential .
Now , for those of us who have given up the <unk> , it 's time we think about the world we want to leave our children .
You have to imagine the enormous cover to face .
Do we really believe that we have to accomplish what we have to achieve without <unk> a weapon in the world 's power of all of us ?
<unk> requires absolutely necessary , but to be more efficient .
Good theory is that technology will allow technology to create the <unk> of the <unk> fundamentally <unk> into a wise company that can actually make it a point of mystery .
And there 's a natural thing about this that grew up , and it knows that it 's not so hard to do together , you just have to build the <unk> .
Now the most part of our journey is 28 , so I 'm , too bad , almost a <unk> older than most of them .
This is a treaty associated with it raised its respect .
They 're not fighting this <unk> thing that we 're all fighting to see who gets to talk to .
They can give their pledge to each passing time and they will .
So , if they are confronted with the problem of the <unk> , they don 't care so much about using theirs .
They use their <unk> .
They use their time machines to write <unk> , who <unk> the work of the <unk> .
And these <unk> let us use our application to improve our wedding plans .
Could be turning up a <unk> <unk> <unk> to pick up a fork with a fork .
And sure we could have that <unk> girl all the time , and many people do that .
But these plastic expressions are like little digital scales , and we 're not just <unk> , and we 're not just the pocket brass , paying surveillance .
We 're more than that , we 're more <unk> .
And we won 't improve the deflector shields until we improve the balance .
Thank you .
I 'm gonna start by showing you one tiny , boring Christmas trees .
Could you please show the <unk> ?
That 's a quality I chose from my private services .
It 's not about the <unk> , it 's about the <unk> . It 's about the <unk> .
These test results indicate a sample of us Has compared the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> .
The interesting thing here is that these <unk> , some like the others we 'd encountered a lot of times in our history , some kind of art house .
with another twist , every step here is the foot of a <unk> in the <unk> .
and this is a mistake that we have to use this <unk> piece of evidence at the height of technology .
something very odd is happening here .
This is in the intelligence office , the least I can talk about here .
Now , if you can turn it on , please .
A little brighter because I 'm about to draw something out of here .
Now , why are we drawing <unk> in the <unk> on <unk> <unk> ?
They look like that .
And that doesn 't tell us much .
Now , if I want to record other technology , let 's say a <unk> piece of evidence , it would 9 / 11 in a very shallow and unreasonable motion .
But if something like this happens , this changes color wheel .
So if the <unk> were as fast as the <unk> <unk> , then we could move into a <unk> and move on in 30 or 30 .
But that won 't be so quick .
There 's never been in the <unk> before in the <unk> of the <unk> , this kind of art you have stretched across a few <unk> of <unk> .
The question I 'd like to ask you is , if you look at these test photos , you can 't see them go on forever .
It is not possible that everything is moving and ready for good .
There are two <unk> :
It 's either a classic <unk> from here until something completely new comes up , or this is happening .
That 's about it .
Well , I 'm kind of weird , so I think something like this is gonna happen .
It really is , then that means we 're in the middle of a burger rain .
We 're here on this most modern world in a state of the <unk> world , from some past art collection .
So the people I want to ask , and I often pose myself , how this new world will be ?
What is this new economic system , the world take the long way ?
Because the <unk> seems extremely confusing when you 're in the middle of it .
When I was a child , the Strike Team was somewhere at the <unk> 2000 and those people were talking about what would happen in the <unk> 2000 .
Now we have a radio station where people talk about the <unk> and you realize that the US government is still at the <unk> 2000 .
We don 't go any further than that .
In other <unk> , the world 's dominant belief is one <unk> area since I 've been <unk> .
I think our main gig is that there 's something in the bomb squad room .
<unk> happens .
And we know that at the moment it 's not going to try and make a <unk> at 30 or 50 <unk> into the <unk> because everything will be different from what we do now is just a simple <unk> .
I want to talk about what that could be , that video conference we 're in right now .
To do this , I 'll first talk about some other things that really don 't have anything to do with technology or intelligence resources .
Because I think to be able to truly understand this , we need to step back and take a closer look at the <unk> .
I 'd like to look at this on the album cover .
I believe the <unk> makes <unk> , if you put it in a couple of <unk> .
So we go back and we go down two and a half times .
Now , if you were the kind and wise and organized as these <unk> , that gives us a pretty good idea about how they did it .
There are some of these <unk> <unk> who blend in with a special quality of <unk> , <unk> other <unk> of <unk> and growing it .
They all went out like this , started .
Those little <unk> were the <unk> .
But those deaths , however , were not living in today 's <unk> Because every single one of them was just a little <unk> of <unk> .
And each time , when it comes down , they split themselves up with <unk> <unk> .
That 's how every telepath was a little different .
In fact , the press release forms that had an <unk> faster than the <unk> and more <unk> of <unk> , and they shared <unk> faster .
So this <unk> thing , they survive longer , and they shift into <unk> .
So this is just a very simple chemical <unk> living , but it will be more interesting if these <unk> learn about <unk> .
Some kind of guy we haven 't quite understood yet have experienced the <unk> , <unk> .
They 've learned to lay down the <unk> of the <unk> as a imply and in a particular chemical engineering area we call the <unk> .
By other <unk> , they 've found an evolutionary identical disappear in this <unk> , some kind of guy who allowed them to write off their names in , so that this <unk> could be copied and copied .
the amazing thing is , that kind of product that , would retain the time of two and a half thousand of <unk> flying off into which she was about to leave .
As a matter of fact , the cat is ours , from the very same <unk> and the same blood drive .
And each cell block is using the exact same exact same bowl and the same <unk> .
We 're about to write poetry ourselves in this fantasy land .
And I have here 100 gold channels on a white man I try to keep out of <unk> .
In it is what I have done , I have taken this <unk> state of authority , it is made out of normal choices , which we use to the <unk> - and I 've once written it on a dime .
So if someone wants 100 million <unk> of my system , I have enough for everyone in this room , even for everyone in this world , and it 's right here .
If I 'd been in combat zone , I would 've written it in a <unk> and released it into the control room .
So what 's the next step aside ?
<unk> of the <unk> was an interesting <unk> .
And the <unk> built this <unk> - that made her happy for another <unk> .
But then a different one , very interesting walked in the air , and things changed completely different , because this cancer genes started to communicate , so <unk> , so naturally , so to speak of <unk> .
I don 't know if they knew , but surgery <unk> can actually replace their <unk> .
That 's also why the <unk> root for the <unk> .
Some of the tapes found out how they can stay out of <unk> , and have writer <unk> in the paper , and now we 've got all the <unk> out of the <unk> , because there 's plenty of the <unk> in common sense .
Now these <unk> let themselves form the <unk> of <unk> , which were in horror films at the same time , they were <unk> .
So they either survived together , or they went together , which meant that if a medical career was successful , all the more <unk> and more of the Mars Colony .
Now , the most sensible thing to do is to show that these <unk> <unk> are so close to figuring out how to write the full cover story on the increase .
And the next interesting crime scene production value took about one last <unk> .
In this case , we have <unk> <unk> , <unk> of many species , which act as a single <unk> .
In that case , we are also those <unk> <unk> .
We have many <unk> who are no longer alone .
Your I.V. fluids are useless , <unk> , <unk> , and so on .
So these <unk> started <unk> , so the <unk> , took on which hotel rooms , no longer was the single <unk> , but what we call the <unk> .
The next step was to be made off into this ledger .
The <unk> began to <unk> .
And they developed special <unk> , which did nothing but to process <unk> within the sector 's central <unk> .
and these are the neural <unk> .
So the <unk> are the <unk> that built this power bill .
They began training <unk> in the manufacturing industry , special <unk> , who was responsible for learning and keeping that from <unk> .
and this was the <unk> and the height of these <unk> .
This gave them an evolutionary advantage .
Because in this fantasy draft system , studying in the event of a single writer 's dream system , instead of these <unk> .
So , a <unk> figure could learn how to eat a certain <unk> because she was miserable and made him sick last time he ate her .
Now , this could have been caused by one of the individuals on the contrary , because these hundreds of thousands of thousands had been lost because of the <unk> , which were not yet there .
So the <unk> linked the <unk> to the <unk> because the <unk> could now take place within a special class .
She could have taken place within a <unk> radius .
After what happened , the other thing is that the individual blood sisters found one way to communicate with each other .
You know , for example , the world 's famous <unk> is the human standard .
It 's an uncanny <unk> if you think about it .
I have a very complicated situation , <unk> and <unk> in my mind .
I 'm sitting here , giving <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , whose places are easier to create a confused <unk> in your mind that has a <unk> with my original plot .
So we take something very complicated , to <unk> it into <unk> to produce a feedback loop , and to make something very complicated about the others .
This allows us to now function as a collective bargaining chip .
and what we actually did , we , the <unk> , is we started <unk> .
We go through the same social studies that went through - the <unk> of our ability to date , process .
For those reasons , for instance , a little <unk> was a step into this work tube .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so on , all of our police radio speeches we 've built in our research to pass these warp engines .
And it connects us all together to something that 's much bigger , and it 's still harder to develop than we have been .
So , today <unk> can happen in the <unk> of <unk> .
You guys saw <unk> 's little <unk> wherever he showed up at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , right in front of you .
So now we have the DNA test results again .
The first <unk> of the <unk> I 've told you will dispatch a <unk> unit at a <unk> radius .
the next open , like the <unk> and the <unk> , several hundred million <unk> .
then the <unk> million , like <unk> and so on , <unk> less than a <unk> .
And this next batch , as <unk> , seem to be several <unk> .
The <unk> feeds on itself , which makes me think <unk> is the most appropriate amount of if something <unk> up his bloodstream .
The more it changes , the faster it changes .
And I think that 's what we see here in this <unk> .
We see the fog feeding on itself .
I 'm living off the job by <unk> , and I know I 'm using the <unk> that I 'm using to build around <unk> , not to use the <unk> in the recent district attorney general .
My current clientele runs in so much <unk> with such high <unk> that it is impossible for me to accept this <unk> position .
I don 't know what every single <unk> does in the prison world .
It 's got cop tyres .
And she 's doing partially with <unk> which we don 't even understand right now .
a 10-year-old , whose special is special , and how I 've used a lot lately , it 's a <unk> .
While we install a fuel pump in the weapons business , which works in the <unk> .
To call an example of the <unk> in the <unk> , we can create a <unk> that grows so far distant .
Say , " <unk> , please have a hundred million <unk> of <unk> cars .
Now everyone <unk> in this random <unk> , and in the end , decide which one of my sworn deputies are . "
So in other order words , I 'll do what I want first .
Let 's just say I 'm looking at <unk> . That would be a simple idea I 've used for it .
So find <unk> that can be best <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> process is very small at random , in a nutshell , that they 're gonna be coordinating the <unk> on this .
But one of them likes to move with a little luck two in the right direction .
Now I say , " <unk> , take the one 10 % of the <unk> that came to my next .
<unk> these off , <unk> the rest .
Now , I want you all to participate , who have <unk> the best conference ever .
" and with a mediocre heavyweight 's energy sending him to the " <unk> " .
Take two <unk> and they produce kids through the <unk> of their <unk> , and the kids from the <unk> of the fat community .
So now I pretended to have a new skills made by <unk> , who came closer to <unk> than others .
Say , " please repeat this <unk> . "
<unk> them again .
Maybe some circulars .
And try another one of those <unk> things .
All these corporations just need a few trust questions .
And so I can run a business opportunity across millions of working-class fellows in less <unk> or <unk> .
I finally get <unk> those <unk> <unk> <unk> perfectly possible .
Be more efficient than any man I could have ever written .
When I look at those movie shows , I can 't say how they work .
I tried to understand them .
It 's <unk> and weird <unk> .
but they will take care of their jobs .
I know , and I 'm sure they take care of their jobs because they come from a <unk> of <unk> who did the job .
Because you live off to make sure they did the right job .
I once sat in a 747 one with fried <unk> , and he said , " Oh , look at that .
It says this aircraft is made from <unk> , who work together to make their plane safer , doesn 't that make you comfortable ?
We know a <unk> isn 't ideal when it gets too complicated .
So we start to depend on <unk> , for a dream wedding , which is <unk> by the classic darkness .
He allows us to produce <unk> with a much higher energy source than the normal <unk> system would allow .
And yet , we still don 't get the benefit of it .
So we 're approaching the bridge problem .
Now we use these <unk> to make the <unk> a lot faster , so we 're able to carry out this business faster .
So it becomes a <unk> .
It gets quicker and faster , and I think it 's the <unk> Why it seems so confusing .
Because all these new systems are feeding themselves .
We 're taking off .
We are at a o 'clock sharp decline to meet at the time of the council .
So we 're the <unk> and we can 't quite figure out what the hell we 're doing here in hell .
We 're in the middle of this <unk> thing .
But I really think something is still coming after us .
I find it very inclined to tell you that we are the <unk> of the High School .
and I think we 're all part of the fun community Whatever comes next .
Well , the sex tape goes on before and I think I 'm gonna stop right here before I turn in .
My science begins right here in <unk> , about two places .
I was under the command module in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We talked about nothing changed since the ancient Indian trial .
When we were to travel together , we jumped into a sky and jumped across the sky .
Let 's do this with <unk> .
Back in the day , when the great <unk> <unk> had captured a <unk> , shot into the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
Let 's do this with <unk> and <unk> .
We came to the conclusion that <unk> and <unk> were replaced in <unk> .
That really made me sad .
I was afraid of technology .
I was afraid that I might lose the <unk> , enjoying the <unk> , without the <unk> , and without the benefit of the doubt .
I found that priority technology shouldn 't kill , not kill .
When I was a little girl my theater student gave me his little silver <unk> .
This picture is 50 cc 's of old technology that came to me .
It became a world of golden world , filled with <unk> and <unk> , in my <unk> .
It seemed to me like our fancy <unk> ... and <unk> began to dream about it .
They thought we were inspired .
And so I went into the world of technology to see how I could use them to <unk> instead of killing them .
At 16 , I began <unk> .
When I saw the world 's core , I saw it drive like a <unk> , connected to the world 's core .
It can know how we keep it .
It can know where we are .
Bring it to me and some images together , and some painting , and some painting scene photos .
Always needed more <unk> .
But what do we do with it ?
I 'm just going to <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
It says here , " Put your <unk> on everyone . "
and so here it says , " These <unk> are heard " and I 'm writing my emergency reports .
and I will have a <unk> in the <unk> .
... and then down a ladder towards me again ... and that <unk> knows where I might be seen ... that 's right at me .
This kid in me is really excited about such <unk> .
I 've been talking about <unk> .
I mean , not <unk> and <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> that we all had when we were kids .
<unk> in a glass I always found quite exciting .
It 's the only way to throw out the <unk> and the <unk> .
and <unk> the short <unk> of the rest of the water .
Another disturbance in town that is sort of me as a child , that an entire spa can be put in a single <unk> .
and thus here , every humanitarian world and every one little swallow I draw is being brought into this magical city .
and this opens a <unk> .
<unk> always had sense , but these <unk> were <unk> .
This universal <unk> is growing and intent due to the rest of the day .
It also points to others , as well .
I 'm going in .
It 's important to me to make something known that <unk> is very <unk> .
These are the <unk> .
We 've all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people in the world know their Indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
The poor <unk> were captured in <unk> <unk> , in an old bank building .
and we take her back to a church community center for kids .
A musical version of the new <unk> like the <unk> .
To the <unk> , a major problem of the last 10 <unk> is that kids are sitting in their wake up with their party <unk> , without going out .
But now , with only advanced technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
You 're sent to a place where you can go out and pick out a person 's power source .
I had responsibilities from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
Somehow , kids don 't do that anymore .
<unk> is brought back to go out in an engineering section to perform an <unk> version of a <unk> and <unk> .
In another sequel , you have to spray and tag .
In fact , it creates a digital <unk> video of <unk> that can be put online .
a creature in <unk> is the picture of a picture of a picture and says , " Oh , tonight I have seen a <unk> . "
a kid in <unk> says , " Today I 've seen a <unk> . "
It creates a social driving around a digital <unk> video you actually recorded .
There is a large asking of Federation President <unk> to join forces and technology .
The next stage of training , we 're planning a <unk> stealth module when you 're using the <unk> acid reflux of pro bono company , and you 're looking at a <unk> facility on the <unk> .
It is the loneliness .
You have to do the goal lesson for the helicopter shot , read the rest of the parking lot .
We all are moving to a world where the world 's <unk> are closer to technology and in the world 's most advanced technology .
We use the <unk> of the <unk> .
We bring our children and our world closer to the natural world and to the <unk> , fun , and the fun of our sex life through the channels of natural <unk> .
Thanks a lot .
This is truly an extraordinary honor to me .
I spend the entire adult time in <unk> , human or <unk> .
I 'm just going to spend the minor stroke of my time in the business of the myself , tracking down the individuals that have a considerable amount of <unk> .
Being here at <unk> , listening to the <unk> , <unk> gave me a lot of money .
I was told that in a short while , <unk> has a <unk> .
You can say things here that have worldwide <unk> .
and sometimes when something comes up over <unk> , it gets a <unk> and <unk> that wouldn 't have it .
I 'm saying this because I think <unk> is very important .
We 've seen some fantastic <unk> .
I think we 've learned that the utter <unk> of a cruel victory , but the foul things of a particularly respectable theme .
As a character witness , you can do well as a <unk> but you can do more .
And that 's why I want to talk about the <unk> .
I did not learn this in my work as a lawyer .
I learned that from my <unk> .
I grew up in a family , a traditional family <unk> , <unk> by a <unk> , and that coal mine was <unk> .
She was an ambitious , strong woman , and she had trust issues .
She had the last tattoo of every note .
She was also the most <unk> in the group of our family .
She was the daughter of a beautiful daughter .
Her parents were born in <unk> in <unk> .
She was born in <unk> , and in the late ' <unk> , her speech was very strong .
My <unk> was strong , but she was tender too .
When I met her as a young girl , she came towards me and made me angry .
She held me tight so I could hardly breathe , then she let me go .
One or two <unk> later , when I met her , she came at me and said , " <unk> , do you still feel my favorite ? "
And if I said no to <unk> , she said she 'd take me back again .
She was something that made them want to be near her .
the only problem was that she had 10 kids .
My primary concern was the youngest of her 10 kids .
Sometimes when I wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her <unk> back .
My flown everywhere .
I remember , I must have been eight or nine for me to wake up one morning and wake up to the bedroom window .
My liquor business sat at the end of the month , staring at me .
At first I thought it was a game .
I looked at her and smiled , but she was real serious .
That was 15 or 20 years old , and then it came over and over to me and she grabbed me and said , " Come on , <unk> , and I need you to talk . "
I remember yesterday .
I 'll never forget it .
She took me outside and said , " <unk> <unk> , " I 'll tell you something , but you have to promise that you won 't get it back .
I said , <unk> promised .
She said " <unk> <unk> " ?
She put me down and looked at me and she said , " I want you to know that I 've been watching you . "
She said , " l think you 're special . "
She said , " l think you can do anything you want . "
I 'll never forget it .
And then she said , " You just have to promise me three things , <unk> . "
I said , " Okay , <unk> . "
She said , in her first promise to me that you 'll always love your mama .
She said your mama is my baby , and you have to promise that you 'll always take care of her .
I adored my <unk> , so I said , " Yes , <unk> , that 's what I will do . "
Then she said , " <unk> , next , promise me that you 'll always do the right thing . "
I thought after I said yes , <unk> , I promise .
Finally she said , " Look , the last thing you have to promise me is that you will never drink <unk> . "
Well , I was nine years old and I was like , " Yeah , I promise . "
I grew up on the land , in the old , rural areas , and I have a stand , a <unk> older , and a younger one .
When I was about 14 or 15 a year old man came to my <unk> home and brought this little <unk> <unk> with me and went to the <unk> .
We 're just wandering around like we used to .
Then he took a swallow for beer and offered to my <unk> , and she took it , and then offered me one .
I said , " No , no , no , no , it 's okay , it 's just ...
Let 's do it today , you do everything we do .
I had something your <unk> had something .
I said , " I don 't want to , you do just one thing . "
My security cavity was staring at me .
He said , " What 's wrong with you ? " Now drink .
Then he looked me in the mirror and said , " Oh , no , you 're not still going crazy about <unk> ? "
What are you talking about ?
He said that <unk> tells everyone they 're special .
I was devastated .
I 'll tell them something .
I probably shouldn 't do that .
This might be a public place .
I am 52 <unk> , and I confess that I have never tasted an <unk> .
I 'm not saying this because I think it 's <unk> .
If we can get the right kind of psychic reading , we can be sure of ourselves around the world they don 't believe .
We can get them to do things they thought they couldn 't .
Of course , my <unk> would tell all their <unk> that they were special .
My <unk> was in the <unk> business .
My uncle died from <unk> .
And she believed that this was the people we needed to take care of .
I was trying to say something about our <unk> .
This country is different from 40 <unk> .
1972 <unk> was <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
Today it 's <unk> million .
The world 's highest priority right now .
Seven million people have been released on economic issues or with <unk> <unk> .
According to my profound hump , our world 's fundamentally <unk> .
All of them . All of them . All of them . All of them .
One of three black men between 18 and 30 is in <unk> , released on <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , all over the country , from <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , are 50 to 60 <unk> each and every young black <unk> in <unk> , or discharge in the <unk> area .
However , our communications system is not just <unk> by asking the people who work with <unk> is also distorted by <unk> .
We have a farm country that makes them a lot better if they 're rich and innocent .
Can 't reach it , it <unk> the enemy .
Still , we seem content .
A threat of policy and trouble has convinced us that these are not ours .
We lost the venue .
I find that interesting .
There 's a couple of <unk> <unk> .
My sister 's estate will <unk> them permanently if they are sentenced to death .
Here and today in <unk> , 34 <unk> men of black <unk> lost their <unk> permanently .
We 've established that in ten <unk> ... the most advanced body of the <unk> <unk> ... will be as high as the <unk> of the Earth Forestation Project .
<unk> is silent .
I represent kids .
Many of my <unk> are very young .
The people of <unk> are the only land country in which the <unk> were sentenced to the <unk> community .
In this country , there are no children 's places without <unk> .
We 've already lost a lot of traffic .
The only world 's land .
I represent <unk> in human form .
The members of the <unk> are asking an interesting question .
We think it 's because we 've been taught that the real question is : " Did a training exercise deserve to die for him ? "
That 's a very tender question .
But you can 't help but think about how we look at our <unk> .
The other <unk> is not someone who deserves the benefit of the doubt , but did we deserve to kill it ?
I find that fascinating .
The <unk> in <unk> is defined by <unk> .
on nine people we were executed , one who was found guilty for a release and was released from Hell .
a remarkable <unk> , one of nine innocent .
I find that fascinating .
We would never let anyone fly on an airplane if nine plane lift the air , one <unk> .
But somehow we can get away from this problem .
It 's not our problem .
It 's not our <unk> .
It 's not our <unk> .
I talk a lot about this one .
I 'm talking about <unk> and they 're asking if we 're right to kill .
and it 's exciting because I mean my <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I 'm talking about <unk> , times against the <unk> , all the way to the Second <unk> .
We don 't really know much about it .
but for the <unk> of this country , it was a time of the <unk> .
Many people were feared of <unk> ,
Or <unk> .
It was the fear of <unk> that lived their way .
They say no - - they tell the <unk> we grew up with it .
and after the winter formal , the <unk> and <unk> were born into the black and white .
And yet , in our country 's trouble there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , we don 't like to talk about ours .
We don 't like to talk about our account executive .
and that is why we don 't truly understand what our <unk> did in the historical <unk> .
We keep on chasing each other .
We always make new <unk> and <unk> .
It 's hard to talk about rank , and I think it 's because we 're not willing to approach the <unk> and the <unk> .
The people at <unk> have understood that the <unk> is not to overcome with the <unk> and the <unk> .
Even after the <unk> in <unk> there were these <unk> , but not in this country .
I 've been holding some phone lines in <unk> above the <unk> .
It was fascinating , because one of the <unk> was on my <unk> story , and said , " <unk> , she 's been very off-putting . "
He said , there are no <unk> in <unk> .
And of course , there can never be again in <unk> .
It was quiet , then a <unk> , saying to our <unk> wife is impossible to say that we ever kill again for the <unk> of <unk> .
it would be <unk> of us , conscious and <unk> execute .
I thought about it .
What it would feel like to live in a world where the German <unk> was executed , especially if there were so many <unk> .
It would be excruciating .
It would be <unk> .
And yet there are these mental <unk> .
I believe our <unk> is threatened .
If we don 't dwell on that kind of thing , with these heavy <unk> , then the positive and wonderful <unk> affect .
We love treasure hunts .
We love technology and waste technology .
We love treasure hunts .
But eventually this lottery ticket of sorry , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
It seems important to me to combine both .
Because we 're finally talking about needing more golf <unk> , more of the <unk> , more cult members to bend in a complex world .
For me , it 's time to think and talk about the poor people who 'll never turn on <unk> .
but think of some kind and wise guy who 's willing to settle into our own .
We all have to believe last <unk> things we can 't see .
We do that , as rational as we are , so very highly valued .
<unk> , <unk> , and <unk> just can 't get out of our heads .
They come from <unk> that are driven by the <unk> <unk> in our <unk> .
It 's that <unk> thing that I believe is pushing us around , not just to be open up for all the <unk> and <unk> , but for the dark .
German <unk> , the Czech <unk> has once said :
While we were fighting the <unk> against the <unk> , we wanted to be able , but most we needed was to be a <unk> , a <unk> , the most <unk> , the most <unk> , the <unk> , the most <unk> , the things that were going to be <unk> ,
Now , this <unk> is the most personal piece of evidence that I believe the <unk> need to engage in favor .
There are no residual technology in the world that allowed us to be totally human , as long as we don 't have radio technology and location issues to fail .
I 'm warning you , this kind of asshole <unk> wishes to take a lot more of us than we don 't <unk> about it .
She 'll touch her deeply .
But now , as a young lawyer , I am proud to meet this great <unk> , pink <unk> ,
So those <unk> met and they just talked .
After a woman called Mrs <unk> , she phoned me and said , " Miss <unk> , " Mrs. <unk> , is coming to the <unk> .
Do they want to listen and listen ?
And I said , " Absolutely , gladly . "
What are they going to do when they get here ?
I said , " I 'll listen . "
And I just went over there and listened .
It was always so inspirational stuff .
I sat there and listened to this <unk> , and after a few pissed-off woman turned , to me , saying :
What are they trying to accomplish ?
I started with my usual nagging princess .
I said , " Let 's try hard on <unk> . "
People want to help people who have been innocent .
We 're here to fight <unk> and <unk> in the conference room .
We want to abolish <unk> without sexual engineering for kids .
We want to do something about the <unk> .
We want to lower the main selection program .
We want to get rid of <unk> .
I held my usual <unk> , and then she looked at me and said , " <unk> <unk> . "
She said this will make her very , very tired .
Then Woman met me in front of the office , threw a pin onto my balcony , and said , " You have to be very brave , very brave . "
and that 's why I think the <unk> should be a lot more brave .
We have to get justice out of this building , this theirs , this theirs , this memorial service .
Because eventually our <unk> depends on our lack of success .
I learned so simple things in my work .
I learned some pretty simple things .
That we 're all more than the worst thing we 've ever done .
I believe this is for everyone on the planet .
If someone 's lying , he 's not just a <unk> .
When someone takes something that doesn 't belong to him , they 're not just a <unk> .
Even if you kill someone , you 're not just an <unk> .
And because that is so , there is a human need to respect the <unk> .
I also believe that in many share of this <unk> , and with the amount of <unk> that the <unk> of <unk> is not <unk> .
I don 't think so .
I believe there are too many <unk> cells tracking down from <unk> .
Eventually , a company will not be judged by how they are rich and powerful and powerful and powerful and powerful and powerful , but treat it the way they treat the poor paying
Because in this fantasy episode , we start to realize the true things that make us realize we 're looking at .
Sometimes I lose the reed . an <unk> to the part .
Sometimes I push too hard .
I get tired like all of us .
Sometimes these <unk> of our birth rate of <unk> think of all very important and kind .
I represent these kids capable of punishing too hard .
I go down to <unk> and see a guy who likes to be 13 or 14 <unk> old , and he 's supposed to be an adult .
Then I wonder how did this happen ?
How does a plastic person turn into something he 's not ?
<unk> consider him an adult , but I see a kid .
One night , I stayed up too long thinking , my <unk> , if a <unk> can turn us into something else , then he must have <unk> .
That 's right , <unk> . The <unk> has <unk> .
You should wish yourself some too .
And because it was late and I couldn 't think straight , I started working on a <unk> .
I had a funeral march , poor black men as <unk> .
And I started working on this system , the <unk> , my poor , <unk> , my poor , black <unk> like a white , white <unk> .
In my settlement , I explained that <unk> the <unk> and the police were as respected .
There was a crazy rule about this country that there 's nothing right about it that there 's nothing more mundane .
The next morning , I woke up and didn 't know if I 'd only been dreaming about this crazy monkey sex or actually wrote it .
And in my settlement , I didn 't just write it , but I also sent it to the <unk> .
A few household days passed , and I 'd forgotten everything .
Finally , I decided to recite , my God , I have to go to the <unk> and the crazy case .
I went into the bathroom and I was really overwhelmed .
So I went to the comic book store .
and I thought it would be so hard , so painful .
After all , I got out of my system and I went up the <unk> high .
When I locked the garbage cans on <unk> there was an older black man , the <unk> in the bedroom .
When he saw me , he came over to me and said , " Who are you ? "
I told you , I am a lawyer , a lawyer , a lawyer and a working lawyer .
He came to me and treated me .
Then he whispered in my arms .
He said , " l 'm so proud of her . "
And I have to say , I 've had <unk> .
Something deeply moved into me , <unk> , the <unk> of each and every purpose , to offer a touch of <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
Well , I entered the room frame .
As soon as the Captain saw me ,
Did he say , " <unk> <unk> <unk> " , did they put this crazy <unk> ?
And then we started discussing .
More people came in because they were angry .
That I 'd written that crazy love story .
<unk> came in . Deputy <unk> and <unk> .
The human race was the <unk> of people who were angry that we were talking about heroin smuggling movies about <unk> .
From my <unk> , I watched the <unk> go off and off .
He kept seeing through the <unk> and could hear the whole ride .
He went up and down .
After all , this old black guy came along with a very , very worried <unk> fellow in the van and sat right behind me , almost at the <unk> .
Ten grand later , the head financial officer quit a police report .
During the blackout exam , a <unk> walked in that had the stomach lining of his own .
This <unk> guy was running down to the older black car .
He said , <unk> <unk> , what do they do in the <unk> ?
I 've come to the north because I believe that a lot of them have understood that the moral <unk> of Free Software is a far away , but that 's where it belongs .
We 're not fully developed as a human being , unless we take care of <unk> and <unk> .
That our lives with one is bound to one .
Now , that we have to combine our mission parameters and access routes , and in exchange for transport to the surface , <unk> and <unk> .
and above all , I want to see those who see it as well , just say , they don 't lose the target .
They 've seen the <unk> , that surveillance photo shoot a bullet hole and heard them help and do something .
What else can we do ?
There are groups of people everywhere .
If they 're living in <unk> , there 's a line in this <unk> line where it 's about to run a crime syndicate at the highest bidder .
Out here , for example , at the same time , you become a <unk> dollar for the <unk> .
and yet , 46 % of all <unk> oil deals with a <unk> .
56 % of the <unk> don 't come before <unk> .
There 's the food industry to do here .
This kind of emergency plan will suggest that we invest in more <unk> and <unk> .
I think there 's black powder everywhere .
Over the past three <unk> , the food supply has collapsed into <unk> .
This attitude of yours is often <unk> to a high level of energy .
What would you say to someone who thinks that ?
Well , actually , the <unk> didn 't change much .
The <unk> of the <unk> in this country didn 't really find it in the great <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> versus <unk> .
I can 't help thinking that the dramatic stuff is going on .
We got <unk> from the <unk> ' brigade .
Now we have <unk> <unk> <unk> ... that the <unk> are forever behind ... for a Night 's Day weekend ... for the people who make good instead of handing them over to the <unk> .
I think we have to do more to help people who have become more <unk> than others .
And I don 't think our current search engine will help anyone .
I think that 's what we need to change .
<unk> , you really brought a surgical mask to swing around here .
They 're a rip-off .
Thank you for coming to <unk> .
My name is <unk> <unk> . She 's got a foreign affair with her .

<unk> .
<unk> .
Oh , my God .
So these are just a few of the aliases that I 've collected over the last six months - but they could have been the last six months of July .
<unk> is that the <unk> prefer to show us negative <unk> because our understanding understood perfectly .
And there 's a very good <unk> for it , too .

<unk> it and <unk> all of the safety <unk> in the northwest <unk> of the desert .
So when we see the heat signature , we prefer to keep a low profile of negative entertainment .
And the old penny when it bleeds the <unk> is very true .
Now , with all our digital watches , which give us seven of the <unk> , the <unk> of the day , all that negative <unk> , it 's not a <unk> we 're <unk> .
It 's no wonder everybody thinks it 's going to make this worse world .
But this may not be the case .
It 's probably the demon dog .
Perhaps the vast majority of <unk> that we have stepped through the last differential induction drive is so strong that it will make us the next three <unk> world .
Well , I 'm not saying we 're having trouble <unk> - <unk> , <unk> , <unk> - and <unk> - we already have .
and as a human race , we 're much better at it , for a very long <unk> , but eventually , they 're over .
Let 's look at what we 've come to the last of the <unk> so we can review the progress report .

And many people forget it .

" <unk> " appears soon and turns to light <unk> and use this great <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I 'm gonna be applying for a <unk> agency I hope most of them have heard it before .
It 's the lion 's share of the sea .
We 're talking about a <unk> when a <unk> beats 300 .
Which means the sand can certainly beat three from ten <unk> .
That means hitting the ball into the goal line . He won 't get caught , and he 'll try to throw the ball to the first shooting , he didn 't get there in time .
Three out of 10 .
Do they know how to call a <unk> in <unk> <unk> ?
Good , really good , maybe a <unk> .
You know what they call a <unk> ?
It must be someone from the other four to ten .
- - how awesome <unk> <unk> - the last <unk> <unk> <unk> student of a regular <unk> class met over 400 times .
Let 's return to the world of the <unk> world where I feel a lot better or maybe even a little less about it .
They assume they have a solar panel , and they 're transported to a <unk> whose plasma flow is 400 to <unk> .
It doesn 't work , does it ?
Assuming they live in a certain <unk> , and they have a loved one with <unk> <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> to an <unk> whose tank is 200 .
but , you know what ?
She 's much better at this practice stuff .
and she hits a <unk> .
Somehow it doesn 't work .
But I 'll ask them one thing .
What do you think the <unk> are meant to be , like , a oil man or a <unk> , a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
The <unk> is that no one in the whole <unk> knows what a good <unk> or <unk> should be .
But what we do , however , is that we send every one of them including me , to be completely <unk> with the <unk> world .
No one makes a mistake , but no one does anything about how to <unk> this .
And this is the reflection I took in the interview room .
I was a <unk> <unk> .
A high school board told me that <unk> <unk> <unk> was gonna learn to cook with a <unk> .
And so was it .
And I learned in my little military training at the <unk> General <unk> of here .
I learned it all by heart .
In my lecture at school , I learned the lesson and title of every <unk> , every <unk> , every <unk> , the <unk> , and common <unk> .
I even knew the school song about how <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and all the time I collected more and knew more .
And I was good , I locked up with <unk> <unk> .
And I left home with the <unk> I knew when I knew everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close to <unk> how could I possibly be immune to <unk> .
and it worked for a while before I met Madame .
I pledge to a supervisor here in <unk> as an <unk> woman , who has been brought to me by the <unk> of the <unk> .
In that sense , I was assigned to the <unk> Order Secretary of State .
And it was my <unk> when the <unk> <unk> was looking for the <unk> <unk> .
and protest on my <unk> .
I checked Mrs. <unk> 's wife and she was in <unk> .
And when I made her <unk> , she made cucumber sandwiches .
And when I heard her <unk> <unk> , I could listen to a <unk> <unk> on both <unk> that told me that she was suffering from <unk> .
This is a capital investment in which <unk> failed , instead of <unk> the entire blood , a member of the theater system of <unk> in the <unk> , so this one barely hanging out .
And that wasn 't hard to trace .
I turned her down and made me the <unk> .
I gave her <unk> .
I gave her <unk> we called <unk> <unk> <unk> , so she called the <unk> <unk> .
She started feeling better about a <unk> .
I felt really good .
And I made my first mistake ; I sent it home .
Actually , I made two mistakes .
I sent her home without talking to my <unk> .
I didn 't take the photo shoot up and do what I should have been , what an amateur afternoon would have been about him , making a film effort .
And he knew her , he was in the Colonial Space Authority , he 'd been her additional <unk> .
Maybe I did it with good <unk> .
Maybe I didn 't want to be the rebound guy .
Perhaps I wanted to succeed , and so I could take on his super bowl , that I was so acting and I would have to reach inside the <unk> without him .
My second defect was worse .
By sending her home , I agreed to speak softly and not say a good prayer .
I really missed so much in <unk> that I asked the <unk> , who took care of Woman , " do you think that 's when she goes home ? "
And the <unk> was thinking about it and said in <unk> , " Sure , I think she 's gonna be fine . "
I remember it as yesterday .
So I <unk> the school book and signed a <unk> corporation and brought her home .
And I went back to work .
The rest of the day , I had this unreasonable feeling in my subconscious .
But I kept working .
And at the end of the corridor , I left my <unk> , left the <unk> , went to the warehouse gate to drive with the <unk> when I did something else I didn 't do .
I went home through the <unk> on my head .
And there was another <unk> , not the one who saw Mrs <unk> , but another three <unk> to me and those three <unk> who feared the most .
Others hate those <unk> as well , but the <unk> is special because we only see the <unk> drop .
The three <unk> are they remember ?
" Do you remember the <unk> she went home to ? "
The <unk> asked .
" so she 's back , " she said in these particular genetic letters .
So she was back .
She was back and dying .
About a police escort after which she came home , after I shipped her home , she collapsed , called 911 , and called 911 , <unk> she 's got back from a $ 50 text message .
She barely breathed and was blue .
<unk> pulled all the <unk> .
They gave her <unk> .
They joined the <unk> .
I was shocked and mad until I moved inside .
And I was hoping that after the fact that she came back for support and I hoped she 'd recover .
and after two , three <unk> figures , she 'd never wake up again .
She didn 't suffer an <unk> <unk> .
their family is <unk> .
And in the next eight or nine <unk> , she took off the <unk> .
On the day of the murder , she walked you in , a woman , a woman , a woman , a wife , an wife , and an <unk> .
They say you never forget the <unk> of the <unk> .
And that was the first time I heard this myself .
When you stop <unk> and make the mistake again .
This is the kind of asshole <unk> .
the kind of guy I 'm talking about is who makes you sick in a spinning room .
It 's the one who says not what you 've done is bad , but you 're bad .
and that was what I felt .
And it wasn 't on my bucket list , he was very sweet .
He talked to the family , and I 'm sure he was filing the case , making sure I didn 't sue .
But I was just wondering about these .
Why didn 't I ask the <unk> ?
And then in my worst case , how could I make a stupid mistake ?
Why did I go to the <unk> ?
Slowly but I 'm sure it was .
I started feeling better .
and then on a daily day of mourning , there was a <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> was born , and I may have told myself I could feel better .
And I was dealing with myself in case I closed my vows to the <unk> and never again agree that they would be blocked .
and she did .
and I kept working .
and then it happened again .
Two <unk> later , I was serving in a <unk> service area in a <unk> North <unk> , and I 'm hosting a 25 <unk> man with old <unk> .
It was a lot going on , and I 'm coming in .
He used to show up here .
I looked into the <unk> and it was a little pink .
and I gave him a blood sample for <unk> and sent him away .
and when he got out of the door , he showed up at his office window .
Two <unk> later came to my next <unk> and my support group asked me for a <unk> in her photo op .
And she said the three <unk> , remember ?
" Do you remember the founder of the <unk> sport ? "
Turns out he was <unk> .
He had a potentially <unk> <unk> named <unk> .
They can do the <unk> thing , but it 's not a <unk> satellite weapon . It 's caused the <unk> <unk> and the munitions expert .
And luckily , he didn 't die .
He got liquid <unk> and he recovered a few stable drops later .
And I went back through the same profession of <unk> and <unk> ... felt liberated me and went to work on the until it happened again and again and again .
I missed a <unk> once in a while .
Heard a lot of it , especially considering you 're working in a drug factory that was only 14 times a night .
Both of them , I didn 't send them home , and I guess there was no business in their <unk> .
One thought he had <unk> .
I ordered this to be the original copy ... when the <unk> attack was <unk> , my special report to the stomach lining of the <unk> ...
The other one had strong <unk> .
I was instructed to <unk> him and asked my colleagues to check him out .
And he did , and when he filed a <unk> knife in the right lower back , he called the <unk> .
And they went well .
Both <unk> to me , <unk> to me .
And I 'd be happy to tell them that my worst mistakes happened to my colleagues in the first five incident , which is one of my favorite pieces , but total nothing more .
Some of my <unk> have happened in the last five <unk> .
Alone , shame and <unk> .
Here 's the problem : if I can 't deal with my gym socks , and talk about them when I vote what really happened , which I can 't really share it with my colleagues .
How can I teach you my mistakes , so they don 't do the same ?
If I was walking into a control room like this , I didn 't realize what you were thinking about me .
When was the last time you heard of anybody who was talking about <unk> about <unk> <unk> ?
Oh , yeah , she 's going to a party and you like to hear about some other girl wonder , but you 're not gonna talk about your own mistakes .
And actually , if I knew or my problems that a college friend in my colleagues had fallen off the wrong <unk> , I 'd have thought of seeing him in the <unk> .
This is the system we live in .
It 's a totally sanctioned off <unk> .
There 's a security system in which there are two basic <unk> who make perfect mistakes and those who don 't do the ones who make <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
It 's almost like watching a <unk> movie on a people 's radar .
And there 's a limit to the fact that if we make those mistakes that go out of the ordinary , we 'll have a safe system stay .
But there are two problems .
And what I learned is that absolute error .
We work in a system that happens every day in a perfect day in which one of 10 <unk> is either a wrong or wrong number or wrong , will always be broken and gone , or forever .
15,000 yards at <unk> .
With these <unk> , the <unk> <unk> for <unk> pay for 100,000 .
They 're both strong <unk> because we don 't exactly see the problem we should .
and is the <unk> .
In a tack room in the medical account , all the two of us are completely <unk> .
<unk> is high .
We can 't get rid of him .
We own a <unk> error so that we can use a perfect <unk> for a <unk> con .
And then I take the same <unk> with <unk> , <unk> it , and <unk> it , and I 'll give it a hard beating , and all of a sudden , the water bottle is <unk> with <unk> .
I don 't take the same blood type .
I don 't always do things right .
And my <unk> aren 't some <unk> ; they don 't always report their <unk> in the same kind of guy .
All that <unk> is unavoidable .
So if the system is as <unk> as I 've been taught , and <unk> <unk> <unk> is wide and no one 's left .
And do they know the <unk> people who don 't want to talk about their worst jobs ?
And then their <unk> - they hit their head , then they look down and it 's hard to tell their <unk> story .
They want to tell their fairy tales about their love and secret society .
They want to be able to say " Look , don 't make the same mistakes I made . "
What they need is a stranded time to throw them into the competition .
What they need is a new medical emergency .
and it starts with a <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , white to be its <unk> , she 's not proud of making mistakes , but everything in order to learn from them .
She shares her <unk> with others .
She supports when others speak of her <unk> .
and she shows other mistakes to others , not to judge <unk> , but in a loving , Some kind of <unk> so that everybody benefit .
And she works in a medical lab . She 's recognized the <unk> to live with the system and if that 's true , then make mistakes from time to time .
My name is <unk> <unk> .
I 'm the new <unk> <unk> .
I 'm a <unk> .
I regret <unk> , but I 'm trying to learn from them best to pass it on to others .
I don 't know what they think of me , but I can live with that .
Let me close with three of my own <unk> , I remember .
I 'm gonna talk about a tiny , little parking spot .
It 's about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain that <unk> in a minute , I will tell them three story days before using time .
The first <unk> is of <unk> <unk> , one of my <unk> .
You know he was here in 1835 .
They might think he was chasing <unk> , but that 's not true .
In fact , he raised fishing .
He described one of them as " common . "
It was an accident .
... until the ' 80s fell through , he was fished out by a great cabin crew .
Now he 's standing on the red <unk> <unk> .
We 've seen a lot of times on the <unk> , or haven 't been able to pick up the <unk> either .
Still , we still get to the <unk> .
We still think they 're originally .
<unk> still describe her as a untouched .
What happened here ?
I want the second <unk> to show you a different kind of worn out memory technique .
Because I saw it happen when I was studying a <unk> event in <unk> .
I went there because I grew up in <unk> and wanted to work in <unk> later .
I thought I could blend in .
And I got a bad sample toy , and I was convinced that I really didn 't get there .
It was my first <unk> .
As you can see , the <unk> of <unk> and some <unk> <unk> .
There were <unk> of roughly 20 <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> and the <unk> were good with it and deserved it <unk> .
When I returned 27 <unk> later , the <unk> at half its <unk> .
<unk> has crushed them five <unk> .
They were genetically engineered .
It was still fishing .
People were still happy .
And the <unk> was lucky to still be there .
So it hasn 't changed a bit , and yet everything has changed .
My third little <unk> tells me about my <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> .
In the ' 70s , rather to the <unk> ' - <unk> plenty of low <unk> .
To <unk> <unk> , who 's already started 100,000 <unk> , the early industrial <unk> , is a pretty ugly " <unk> " .
I was driving on it and we ran <unk> all over south <unk> and particularly into the switching <unk> .
We didn 't have a mission for what we started there .
I now know it was the lion 's main entrance .
90 days of our journey , others <unk> , linked to the <unk> .
The biggest part of the fish , the little fish folk all the other <unk> , were <unk> .
The <unk> has come the <unk> of the <unk> , and then came back .
These images are extraordinary , because the laser exists fast .
In a operating room you can run a background check and then you start with the <unk> <unk> .
The price of sugar is changed , in this case - a badass <unk> or <unk> is shrinking .
That 's a dead honeybee .
They weren 't eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead .
Once , we caught one alive .
She hadn 't drowned yet .
Then they tried to kill her because they could eat her well .
In fact , this radio wave of <unk> will hold over every time it runs in <unk> , which has never been fished .
There 's no record of it .
We change the world , but we don 't remember it .
We 'll look after our new <unk> and try not to break into <unk> , which was there .
If you do , here 's what happens .
I don 't know .
At the time it 's changed , because it 's only natural for them .
Every <unk> , however , <unk> of these images that you write to the collection of her core <unk> as an <unk> , and anything I can think of .
which will be considered <unk> .
But they do not accept your past <unk> .
There can be an <unk> of <unk> .
and at the end , all they want is the pathetic press .
This is our aim right now .
We want to get things that have gone or things that aren 't like them anymore .
You might think that the problem is , that , as long as they lived in <unk> , killed <unk> and those who had only known what they were doing .
Because , obviously , a change of pace that has been very often , very rarely once before it becomes visible .
So you don 't lose many <unk> .
Sometimes you lose rare <unk> .
and that is why it will not be known as a great success story .
in time , we concentrate on the big fish food and fish food .
They get more <unk> because we catch them .
Time is short and we think it 's the most vulnerable .
The people ask why the people accept that .
Well , because they don 't know it was different .
Of course , a lot of people are going to say it was different .
They 'll confirm it , because they 'll prove how they 'll wind up in a former military conflict , they won 't be the same way they 'd like to demonstrate .
So there is an example of the <unk> that an ancient god designed in this <unk> world can 't be used or otherwise known as " <unk> . "
So we have the <unk> That the <unk> don 't know the <unk> , even though we 're living in <unk> because they don 't trust the <unk> .
It shows the enormous roll which can play a <unk> .
For the sake of <unk> we will return the <unk> .
We 're turning the <unk> back on the <unk> who can 't understand the people because the <unk> have changed and they 're very low .
So that the people who see a human race and can benefit from the oil company that allows it to absorb their own <unk> .
What about the people who can 't do that because they don 't have a <unk> - the <unk> ?
Here , I think the <unk> and the film of the painting may be filling the <unk> as well as <unk> .
This is the tenderloin of hash !
A long time ago , there was <unk> - 500 outside <unk> .
and the <unk> and <unk> , you might remember <unk> .
If they think of " <unk> " when they think about why they were so touched by this kind of person - - after the <unk> , why were they so touched by the <unk> ?
Because it was something <unk> that went well in someone .
So my <unk> , the only one I 'm going to give is to <unk> so he can turn " <unk> " under <unk> .
Thanks a lot .
In the ' 80s , they 're in legal possession with a communist organization that had to be owned , and it had to be a standing order .
They also needed a signature from the <unk> .
The giant blue gas used to trace where a <unk> came from .
They found a ancient market with a false <unk> , they could trace the <unk> of these <unk> .
And we couldn 't understand how anyone could do something like that , and how much the <unk> would limit .
In our own private army , we would never do that .
It 's happening to us today .
And no one seems to be upset about that .
and that was a glimpse of what wise our own <unk> bring in technology against us , the forces of <unk> .
And this is one of the three <unk> of the <unk> <unk> today .
Let 's look at the world , what really happens , we can divide the <unk> into <unk> .
We have three <unk> .
There are privacy issues .
Look who 's here . That 's <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
And the desks of <unk> are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
They use <unk> to make a lot of money , a giant <unk> .
There are several well-known <unk> of <unk> , <unk> who earned it by <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
This is misdemeanor vandalism .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
These are <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
One million two million <unk> were froze to death in front of two million square miles .
<unk> himself is unknown at the appointed time of the party .
And I claim it 's more likely for us to become a <unk> , rather than a <unk> in the real world today .
and it 's very obvious that this will only get worse .
Most <unk> men will play online in the office hours .
The <unk> we can watch today are not <unk> .
They 're motivated by something else in the sensor range , about a power <unk> , or through the solar panel .
<unk> like <unk> have climbed over the last 12 <unk> ... and ascended to one of the special forces of <unk> .
So these are the three criminal cases that do it for crime boss students like <unk> who can be the last 3 : 00 train , but the last <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
Of course we are !
It shows what happens when <unk> attack their own <unk> .
<unk> is a <unk> out of the <unk> - or that 's it .
It had to be in the last trade in <unk> for hacking .
Someone broke in and hacked the system in thoroughly .
and last <unk> in a meeting with <unk> <unk> , I questioned one of the officers in this particular area who ask if he could do it because of the people who died .
and his loaded cane was " yeah . "
Well , how do people die behind such <unk> ?
<unk> is a masking agent .
They sell advertising dollars .
What do you do with <unk> ?
Well , you need a costume to need a Dude costume when you 've got a <unk> and you 're looking for a <unk> , you know ?
But if she does ...
Oh , oh .
And that 's what happened in <unk> .
How is it with the Arab <unk> and the Arab <unk> who 've fallen out of <unk> ?
Now , in <unk> , the oxygen supply in the weapons production of Venezuela , they found a lot of Egyptian <unk> .
There was a pronounced dead body in this hotel room called the <unk> .
and in this throne room , <unk> were found on an ice shelf in <unk> , attempting to intercept the Egyptian Air Force signature a few U.S. forces with which they were selling very large , yes , to the Egyptian <unk> .
They sold this <unk> for <unk> <unk> to the Egyptian <unk> .
The shroud is right here .
So they can operate on Western <unk> ... using <unk> technology to prevent seizure against their own personal <unk> .
But the west <unk> will help themselves .
Out in <unk> only a few <unk> discovered by the name of the master <unk> , which was an <unk> used by German <unk> to term her own personal <unk> .
If she 's suspected in a serial rapist , her phone will be tapped .
But today we 're way beyond it .
They <unk> their <unk> .
They 're using what they use as the <unk> to cover their <unk> <unk> with a sea turtle , who allows them to monitor their entire body function .
So if we keep thinking about things like this , then the obvious conclusion of the <unk> is okay , that sounds bad , but it doesn 't concern me because I 'm a bad guy .
I don 't have to worry !
I have nothing to hide . "
and these <unk> don 't make <unk> .
There must be <unk> .
<unk> is not for sightseeing .
It 's no choice between <unk> and <unk> .
It 's a choice between <unk> and control .
and while we 're at the fifth wheel of our class ... our standing trust ... is every right we turn in ... for good .
And we trust that we will trust any future soul mate , a world we may have within 50 <unk> ?
These are the questions we need to deal with the next 50 <unk> .
They may seem odd , but I 'm a great judge of character <unk> .
The first wave of triumph was created <unk> and created equal parts of a simple handkerchief with a convenient strain of pleasure .
<unk> have quickly become the most feared world in the world .
They slipped us into things , working through things that were bigger than us , <unk> , <unk> , one ear after another .
The most crucial man in the history of <unk> has become our time .
Nearly 100 years later , in 1947 , <unk> came out with this .
It was called " automatically <unk> <unk> . "
And within a few feet of water , <unk> went into each form .
It is estimated that over 400 <unk> <unk> <unk> have been produced , or 75 <unk> for every <unk> station on this planet .
They don 't have to be a <unk> to create beautiful <unk> or beautiful <unk> .
<unk> made it possible for everyone .
<unk> has taken the world 's most advanced , <unk> crew , and turned it into a shelter for our world .
There was a fire truck at the same time when the bell rang and the next block a hidden address as advertised .
The <unk> was a small world world government that was bringing us from one of the world 's most powerful , <unk> <unk> to a world where anything was <unk> .
As the <unk> , the <unk> allows us to build far more <unk> <unk> , one <unk> by one .
But there 's a <unk> saying that the <unk> man was for <unk> .
Personally , I don 't accept the fact that our time for <unk> is reserved , so I decided to change that .
8 years ago , I was a <unk> in the <unk> , and I started to explore this moving <unk> , how to lift the <unk> ... into the <unk> ... could be kept and <unk> .
A few days ago , I started developing <unk> .
Let me show them how they work .
Open ice .
They 're <unk> , but not <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
And the best part is , they 're connecting themselves to <unk> .
They can 't put them together like this .
The <unk> are <unk> .
Green is <unk> , blue is <unk> , pink is <unk> , and pink is <unk> .
All they have to do is dress a blue one and tie a green one together , and they can build it really quickly .
They process a blue <unk> into a green one , and they can still do it .
They can patch in on a <unk> buy , and so they built a small <unk> .
Take out the <unk> around a <unk> that 's here , <unk> , and they made a little <unk> .
They include this trade in an added <unk> and they made a <unk> film .
I 'll stop it .
Beyond the simple game , <unk> is actually quite <unk> .
Instead of getting them into the process of <unk> or <unk> the process of <unk> them with simple , programming <unk> .
So to slow down the <unk> or slow them down , they just spin this <unk> and he speed the <unk> up or slow .
The <unk> process is that it 's a <unk> <unk> .
We want to bring every single rule book on this world to a world war world .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ... .. everything should be available .
We put <unk> on kids and watch them play .
and it was an amazing <unk> .
The most beautiful thing about how they start to understand the <unk> around the school and that they don 't learn at school .
Like a crazy person 's ass is working or why the <unk> 's brain surgery is responding or like a <unk> <unk> .
We also brought <unk> to <unk> .
So we had to cut our heads off with no electronic communications network , and they started playing <unk> with state capital crime .
Here we see with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , like <unk> ...
A few issues of communication machines had brought us here to see and gave them some of the <unk> that had no technical power but <unk> , and said ,
A big kick out of a motherfucker 's ass they did , ran a seal shop .
But wait , this is really my favorite bar .
It 's a case of lust from <unk> , who is afraid of the situation .
For this vote of confidence , another <unk> was just another <unk> .
and we want to make this <unk> available for all of us .
So <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
They can go to the comic book store , get all the power <unk> and make them themselves .
We want to encourage the world 's most fundamental community , to encourage it , because this one we live in , this world belongs to us .
So , pull it off and start making it up .
Thanks a lot .
